Who pays for the maintenance of that grid? The answer is your $5.75 fee. Maintenance to a power grid doesn't just happen when something goes wrong, like during a storm. It's a CONSTANT thing and it's expensive! You have any idea how much linemen (lineworkers?) make? It's substantial. If you truly want a $0 bill, then you have to completely remove yourself from that grid-- which REQUIRES maintenance. But that's not some scam from the electric company. That's just the reality of maintenance."

I'm not sure whether you're complaining about the $5.75 bill from the company or not - but according to your explanations, you seem to be very lucky. I know that certain providers charge way more for the electricity they provide than for whatever electricity you feed to the grid; so you might need to feed 10 kWh into the grid in order to use 7,5 kWh for a net $0. Some others charge way more as \"grid and transmission\"-fees. In many cases, these utility companies have monopolies, so you've got to take whatever fees and rates they charge, so honestly, I think you've got yourself a very sweet deal: hardly paying anything and still getting electricity from the grid whenever you need some..."

Your $5.75 monthly charge on your bill probably also incorporates a fixed fee representing your portion of the costs to support and maintain the utility company's local grid infrastructure. The utility company MUST charge you this fee as long as you are tied into the electrical grid, as it would be unfair (and thus unlawful) for other grid users to pick-up your share of costs to support the grid. Multiply this policy out over thousands of other grid users similar to yourself and you can see why this is the case. 2. Are you participating in a Tesla virtual grid or \"auto-bidder\" program. I'd be curious how the auto-bidder software could positively impact the KwH you generate and sell back to the grid."

Based on your graphics, are your air conditioning inverters? I saw a lot of peaks on the graphics, and, as far as I know, this is the air conditioning starting and turning off to maintain the temperature. And the inverter technology(on air conditioning) instead of it, just go to a low consumption and this maintain the temperature without this peaks, this is a economy on around 60%.(like I said, I don't know if you already have this, but for the graphics, I think is not the case).

You're still using the grid, and if lots of people can opt out of paying for it at all, it becomes a real problem. Somebody has to pay for the grid's upkeep, etc., after all!"

    {
        "comment": "Having a transmission charge makes sense. You\u2019re still using the grid infrastructure and relying on it so it make sense to put a little into the upkeep. Maybe that maintenance fee is built into the kWh charge but in sense to that you pay for the grid even in the months that you don\u2019t use it because it was always an option for you to have access to it during that month anyway."

    {
        "comment": "ok, the ending made more sense, but mine is $14-15 a month, so your $5.75 is not bad. I only do not agree with you about being off the grid though, you are not, you are connected still and use it almost monthly. Your batteries allow you to not need the grid, but you are not off grid. I have had panels are 4 years, very happy with them!"
