- **Marques Brown explains that he hasn't paid for electricity for a year** due to the installation of solar panels on his house, combined with Tesla Powerwall batteries, which generate and store solar energy. (...) **Net metering allows for a zero-dollar electricity bill** as any excess electricity produced is sent back to the grid, creating credits. (...) **The system cost $93,000 after tax credits** but could take about 10 years to fully pay off through savings on electricity. (...) 
ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways for quick navigation: 00:00 ðŸ’¡ Marques Brownlee shares his experience of not paying for electricity for a year, thanks to solar panels installed on his roof and his Tesla electric car. (...) An important part of the solar system is the batteries which store the excess energy generated during the day. (...) Using a system called net metering, the electricity bill can be reduced to $0 as excess electricity generated by the solar panels is sent back to the grid. (...) Marques chose Tesla's fully integrated setup, consisting of Tesla Solar Roof, Tesla Powerwalls for batteries, and the Tesla app for monitoring and control. (...) The system cost $93,000 after a federal tax credit. (...) The payback period for the solar setup is around 10 years, which aligns with the general expectation of 6 to 10 years. (...) Despite producing all its own electricity, a monthly charge of $5.75 is still incurred for maintaining an account with the power company. (...) The current Ford F-150 Lightning already has this feature. (...)
