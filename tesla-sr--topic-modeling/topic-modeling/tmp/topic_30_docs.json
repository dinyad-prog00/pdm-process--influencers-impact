Lower electron rest-levels at lower temperatures produce larger outputs per photon (could be up to 20% iirc!). This could explain the better overall performance in the spring (sunshine-temperature sweet-spot). Perhaps this can be confirmed by plotting outside temperatures on the same graph? Thanks again, lemme know what you think, and keep acing these videos :)"

Another thing that counts is that on high latitude places like New Jersey the sun rays are always tilted southward even around the midday so depending on your roof geometry and location the months around the solstice, i mean may to July , can actually have almost the same solar intensity because when your roof is tilted southward on its majority matching the sun rays direction the incidence will be high even on the early hours of the day because as you know due to the right ascension of the sun the solar rays are changing its direction every hour and the solar incidence lowers when the solar rays are too different of the roof\u2019s inclination deflecting the majority of it."

Electronics don\u2019t like heat and June 20th the the longest day of the year, so these effects lead to April-June being the best months for solar. March, July and August should also be kind of good. September and October get really cloudy and rainy and also dirty with all the leaves blowing around. In Germany we also use a lot of wind energy, so our electricity is cheap until November/early December with all the autumn storms. Autumn (I guess some call it Fall) is known for its strong winds (kids let their kites fly). But Germany, which is mostly north of the 50th parallel is pretty much f*ed from December to March. We used to burn Russian gas through turbines to produce energy, but that plan went to the toilet with Russias invasion of Ukraine (Also some of our supposed friends blew up our infrastructure, so that doesn\u2019t help either; I am of course in complete support of Ukraine nonetheless). Plugging the chord on our nuclear plants was decided 2012, it was not possible to buy any new nuclear fuel (most of it is produced in Russia), so we just prolonged their run time till March and now we basically just have dirty coal for the next winter or extremely expensive LNG. We fought harder for renewables than any other country and now we are still completely f*ed over, that\u2019s extremely depressing."

So best months are April/May becouse sun is up, day is longer than durring winter but as mentioned air is still cold so better cooling of the panels compared to summer when they are overheating (you also are hot becouse you use AC to cool down) therefore they produce less.

Hence July/August doesnt need to be the best month, it's usually (northern hemisphere) the spring months of Mai / June that have the highest yield per sunny hour. The temperature is optimal and the sun is already quite high and long on the sky."

It's impressive to guess what the next thing you'll say is, and then you match it with incredible animations. Also, the reason why May gives the best output is because the efficiency of these panels drops beyond a certain temperature limit. Thumbs up to you Marques."

Not significantly but anything is better than nothing."

        "comment": "Hey marques, Just wanted to point out another thing regarding most amount of production in May, the efficiency of these solar panels also depends on temperature. If temp. Increases beyond a certain limit their efficiency goes down. So, if its like sunny days of june and july where the temperature is very high, the efficiency of these panels goes down a little bit. Thats why in May it is producing the max as the temp. is just about right. As always great video."
