The $5.75 charge you claim for 'just having an account' is misleading. Because, as you freely admit, there are times you still access the main electric grid. Who pays for the maintenance of that grid? The answer is your $5.75 fee. Maintenance to a power grid doesn't just happen when something goes wrong, like during a storm. It's a CONSTANT thing and it's expensive!
My power company charges $18/mo even when I'm net negative energy usage. $5 sounds great :)
$5.75 subscription for an endless battery is kinda neat.
Charging $5.75 a month to keep the account 'active' has got to be some sort of illegal.
$5.75 just to have an account... I have all bills included but my dad says they charge him 95 pounds to just have an account... power companies are horrible.
$5.75 is that not for the privilege of being connected to the gridâ€¦ what about finance cost of $92,000 ? Was that in the 9.6 yr payback?
5.75 just to have an account
The 5.75 isn't just for having an account, they are providing infrastructure and a service for you to be connected to the grid
Honestly, $5.75 monthly for a backup option of a regional grid sounds like a deal.
$5.75 a month is just a money grab for the utility....just think...if they raise the cost 1 dollar times the millions of customers, that's an instant monthly profit of millions just like that....great video
