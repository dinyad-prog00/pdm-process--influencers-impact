May is the best month for my solar system as well (Moldova, Eastern Europe). Solar panels, as well as solar roof, \"like\" cold sunny weather - they perform better when outside is cold, in Summer, even if the days are longer but much warmer, solar panels do not produce so much electricity because they overheat.
Solar panels are also more efficient when it is cooler, that's why you'll generate more energy during spring.
Keep in mind that solar panels, just like batteries also have a optimal temperature range where they generate most energy. Hence Spring is very beneficial 
They do not work well when outdoor temps are below freezing.. they actually function like a giant space heater when it get really cold and become extremely inefficient. But amazing for spring and fall! (...)
