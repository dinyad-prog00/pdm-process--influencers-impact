            "Your math is wrong. You're closer to 20 year return on investment. Another factor people don't often calculate into this is opportunity cost. You don't have an interest rate in your calculations so we can only assume you paid the $97,000 in full. One has to ask the question, what did I miss out on by spending 97k on solar vs a different investment. If you invested 97k in a low cost index fund and we assume that averaged 7% a year, in 20 years that would be 375k. So you essentially lost a lot of money. What killed your return on investment was your power walls. Generally speaking adding batteries to a solar system doubles the cost of your system. I'm not anti solar! I have a 6.4kW system on my house. I paid 8k for it after federal tax credit. I installed myself with he help of a company called project solar. No batteries! My ROI will be in 6 years.",
            "There is something deeply flawed with your math. You have not saved even a penny, and only spent tens of thousands of dollars. It is your money but please do not spread misinformation that solar saves money. It doesn't. 1. A Honda Civic would cost about $40,000 in fuel over 20 years. (similar to a tesla in utility, style and function). Or, about $10,000 every five years. 2. With 3% interest your $92,000 solar system would cost over $122,000 over 20 years. Not to mention if you had $92,000 in cash you could invest it and earn much more than that. 3. An average sized US home uses 11,000 kWh or $1663.20 per year or $16,663 over 10 years. 4. From IRS: The credit is nonrefundable, so the credit amount you receive can't exceed the amount you owe in tax. You can carry forward any excess unused credit, though, and apply it to reduce the tax you owe in future years. Do not include interest paid including loan origination fees. >So, I don't know your income situation but many people would not recover the full credit for years. That means that you would be paying interest on the full cost of the system for the first year until you did your taxes and got your refund. That $122,000 solar system actually costs $162,000 with 3% interest. It is worth noting that you cannot get rates like that anymore. 5. Power company wholesale buy back would not generate enough to cover a 10 year breakeven. I don't have that information but using the rate that I get from APS in Arizona, doesn't support your hypothesis. In ten years you would have recovered at best $36,663 of your costs for electricity for your home and fuel savings for use of an electric car. Not the mention that fact that you have a car that costs MUCH more than a Honda Civic and is about the same function. The net is that you spent tens of thousands of dollars and have saved not even a single penny.",
            "Wow, your typical monthly bill before solar was $805, which means you would have paid off the $92,000 bill in 10 years as you mentioned. However, the average household electric bill in NJ is around $200-300. If this system were installed on someone else's house, like an average NJ household, it would take them 30 years to pay off the $92,000. Considering solar cell degradation, they might need to replace their solar roof before they pay it off. If my electric bill is around $100 to $600 a month, getting this system installed would make me feel like I'm crazy or really terrible at math. Let's say in year one of using the cells, you generate around 8K KWH in May. Fast forward four years later, you may not get the same output on the hottest month. In 10 to 15 years, you might need to use both solar and the grid. After 20 years of using solar panels, you're back to square one, facing a $92k debt to repay, plus the electric bills you ran from while restarting the cycle. Solar cells are great, but they're too expensive to own at the moment. DIY is even better."

            "Net metering in Germany that would be great...",
            "Net metering sounds good and all, but this will very likely disappear very soon. Here in Holland, you can do the same (energy companies have to do net metering by law). The problem is: when you take of the grid in the winter months (more expensive electricity made by coal/gas/nuclear plants), by using credit from self made solar-electricity during summer months (which is very cheap: negative prices here even during weekends), it is a burden on everyone not being able to have solar panels. This is because the law of net metering isn't a subsidiary, but a must do for energy companies. Which means, they will crank up the kWh prices to still make profit. The real problem comes now: here in Holland, 25% of households have solar panels. Let's assume (for easy math) they make as much kWh in a year as they consume (net metering to zero, just like you). They can use the credit to compenate the (higher) kWh prices, so it doesn't affect them. Everyone else pays 150% (50% more) of the price, to compensate for the people that can use the credit during the winter. When 50% of the households have panels and net meter to 0, everyone else will pay 200% (100% more). Extrapolate this to let's say 90% of households have solar panels and net meter to 0, then the 10% of people without panels will pay 10 times more than the value of that electricity should have been, only to pay for the people that can spend their net metering credits. Because, when a lot of people have solar, electricity is abundant in the summers and thus cheap, but not during the winters. Especially when more and more people switch to heat-pumps / AC for heating. The best way for long term will be batteries and v2x (vehicle to everything; you can charge your EV when you produce electricity during the day; or charge anyways because others do and it's cheap during these hours, and you can 'unload' this energy, from your car, to your house during the evening (when there's no sun and your energy consumption is higher). Batteries do basically the same as v2x, but you will see v2x very soon popping up more and more in EVs, because it saves costs on buying extra batteries. Here in Holland, we have a lot of wind and windmills, that make electricity prices low (and sometimes even negative during weekend-nights in the winter) when there is wind and demand is low. During these times, you can charge your EV/batteries very cheaply as well (or run your heat-pump / AC to pre-heat the living room for when you get out of bed). This video was amazing, I found myself diving in this rabbit hole about 1-2 years ago as well. There is so much to it, it never ends. Combine all these things with smart-home appliances (like algorithms to charge/heat when grid prices are low or cool your house with AC when your solar production is high), and you got an even bigger rabbit-hole that is still very much in its infant stage and there's a lot of communities online for DIY projects at home. Long story, but it just says how I share your enthousiasm about this subject :).",

            "- **Marques Brown explains that he hasn't paid for electricity for a year** due to the installation of solar panels on his house, combined with Tesla Powerwall batteries, which generate and store solar energy. - **His goal was to use a sustainable source of energy** to charge his electric car and power his home, while also saving money on electricity bills. - **He describes the basics of solar systems and how they work.** When the sun shines, the solar panels generate electricity for the home. Excess energy is either sent to the grid or stored in batteries for later use. - **Net metering allows for a zero-dollar electricity bill** as any excess electricity produced is sent back to the grid, creating credits. At night or during cloudy days, the system draws from these credits or from the Powerwall batteries. - **Marques used an integrated Tesla system** that includes a Tesla solar roof, Powerwall batteries, and a Tesla app that controls everything. This choice was for simplicity and seamless integration, though it was not the cheapest option. - **The installation process took eight months** from order to activation, including permits, inspections, and materials being delivered. - **His system generates 29.3 kW of solar power** and has three Powerwall 3 batteries that store 40.5 kWh of energy in total, making it a powerful system that meets his energy needs. - **During the summer, his panels produced up to 260 kWh of electricity per day,** which was enough to power his house and charge his electric car without relying on the grid. - **In the winter, he noticed significant challenges.** There were fewer daylight hours, cloudy days, and higher electricity consumption for heating and charging the electric car. - **Despite the challenges in winter,** his overall energy usage remained balanced due to credits accumulated from summer. - **He mentions interesting features of Tesla\u2019s system,** such as a storm alert that ensures the batteries are fully charged before bad weather. - **A unique phenomenon happens in winter:** snow accumulates on the roof, but because the solar roof stays slightly warmer, it melts and slides off in large sheets, which can be surprising. - **Over the year, he accumulated net metering credits,** which allowed him to maintain a $0 electricity bill despite increased winter energy use. The only fee was $5.75 monthly for having an account with the energy company. - **The system cost $93,000 after tax credits** but could take about 10 years to fully pay off through savings on electricity. He reflects that while the system is expensive, it\u2019s a long-term investment. - **Marques ends by highlighting the future potential of electric vehicles** to have bidirectional charging, allowing them to serve as backup batteries for homes, potentially further enhancing energy independence. This video offers insights into solar energy, home energy systems, and Marques\u2019 experience with Tesla\u2019s integrated solar solution.",

After this period, the panels, which are warrantied for 25 years, generate extra income. 21:34 \ud83d\udca1 Consideration was given to a less expensive solar panel array, but the coverage of the solar tiles was more beneficial. 22:31 \ud83d\udd0c The homeowner could afford to use more electricity due to the excess production from the solar setup. 23:57 \ud83d\udd0b Power outages were unnoticeable due to the backup from the solar system and Powerwalls. A storm watch feature also prepares the Powerwalls for significant storms. 25:22 \u2744\ufe0f In winter, the solar roof prevents snow accumulation by staying just above freezing, which maintains solar power generation. 26:47 \ud83d\udcb5 Despite producing all its own electricity, a monthly charge of $5.75 is still incurred for maintaining an account with the power company. 28:13 \ud83d\ude97 The future possibility of bi-directional charging, where Tesla vehicles can serve as a house's backup battery, is exciting. The current Ford F-150 Lightning already has this feature. 29:37 \ud83c\udf0d The solar setup reduces strain on the electrical grid and contributes to the use of clean, sustainable energy.

Assuming you could get 6% investing your money (discount rate), your discounted payback period would look more like 14.7 years, instead of 9.6 years."

            "Our house definitely needs a new roof, and it makes sense to get a roof with solar in mind/at the same time, but the professional solar companies I\u2019ve seen ads for near me smell like a scam. I had a consultation from a company called Pink Solar. They had a kid come to my house, who tag teamed with an older guy over a zoom call, to go over my roof size, estimated generation, cost to install a roof with solar panels and a battery, and so on. They said Oh, we know the guys who can do your roof for a really good cost\u2026 it was like $6 per square foot just for the roofing. I\u2019ve talked to other roofing specialists (who don\u2019t have anything to do with solar), and they say the average in our county is $9 per square foot, plus extra when the roofs have more slope sides and valleys etc (which, with two additions, our small starter home has several). I\u2019ve been advised that you can do a roof like that\u2026 if you cut a lot of corners and get a cheap roof that won\u2019t last. Pink Solar also said they were going to do a whole eco package, with lots of insulation (maybe we could use more, but we already have some insulation), new LED lights (all our lights are smart LED\u2019s already, so that would be a downgrade), a new Nest smart thermostat (I don\u2019t want a Nest in my house, I already have an EcoBee that I like better, has no subscription fee, has remote thermometers for different rooms, and doesn\u2019t have an microphone, so again that would be a downgrade). I asked if we could save money by dropping those downgrades, they said it\u2019s part of the package and would install them all anyway. Final cost for roof, solar, battery, and smart electronics installation was going to be over $60k. After buttering me up with a fairly lengthy consultation, we took a look at my average power usage. Honestly, I forget how many KW I use, but the average bill from 12 months of data was just $55/month. As you can imagine, that\u2019s quite low\u2026 according to my electric utility, we\u2019re in the top 92% lowest power usage/most efficient for our neighborhood already. My eyes about bugged out while watching this video and seeing that MKB spends about $2000/month! Soooooooo I don\u2019t have an electric car (yet! But I did just recently get an electric scooter, and it\u2019s got just enough range for a round trip to an Aldi\u2019s grocery store, so I can get veggies and do small errands on electric), but based on 2021 numbers it would take me OVER 90 YEARS TO PAY OFF THAT SOLAR ROOF (and I don\u2019t crypto mine or anything to use electricity to make money more than I already do, occasionally filming short videos for clients in my small home studio). At that point, they wrapped up, decided for me that I wasn\u2019t going to be interested, and never contacted me again. I say they, because they USED to be known by another name, and they are no longer Pink Solar now\u2026 they\u2019ve changed names again. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642 What\u2019s my takeaway? Insulation, a heat pump instead of traditional HVAC, efficient appliances, lights, and computers (I have an M2 Pro Mac Mini, cheaper than Mr Brownlee\u2019s Mac Studio, uses at max like 40W) all contribute massively to lower bills. For people who AREN\u2019T early adopters, the things I listed are cheaper and mature solutions to give you substantial savings now, plus can save you $$ if and when you do decide to spec out a solar roof some day later. With the way that some lobbyists are affecting taxes and fees, a solar roof currently DEVALUES houses in some districts, shocking and ugly imo, but make sure you do your local research. If it did raise the value of our home, it might raise the value of our modest starter home beyond what starter home buyers are willing to pay, while not being big and nice enough for more well-heeled buyers (would jump way above neighbors\u2019 houses values too). We DO still need a new roof, but Solar is kind of an impractical chicken and the egg situation, and solar will have to stay a dream for now."

            "There is one GIANT PROBLEM!!! The net zero you are achieving may be true for now, because people and governments are pushing for \"clean energy sources\". But it is not a viable solution when too many people start adopting this technology. For this reasons: If everyone produces too much electricity during the day, there is no use for it. It is simply lost. Therefore the cost from putting energy back into the grid can be omitted. When the sun shines, there is an ecess of energy anyways. Therefore it has no value. You might say, this can be solved by having large batteries in the grid. This has two problems: 1. Too expensive (people do not realize what a blessing cheap energy has been in the last 50years) 2. Doesnt solve the problem of having too litle energy for winter. We would need batteries which can store summer energy and give it back in the winter, which is definateley too expensive. You say, that any strain we take off the grid is beneficial. 29:58 NO, you are directly taking money from these large energy firms, by prioritizing solar energy over their Atomic, coal... powerplants. Therefore energy prices will rise with wider adoption of this. You do not even realize, that cheap energy is what has allowed us to have this verry device you are holding. Adittionally the large power plants jave difficulties increasing, or decreasing power output over short periods, which is exactly why solar is more of a problem.",
            "The power company does not pay you for the delivery charge when the power is sold to them but you still pay when you use the power from the grid. This makes no sense when your major charging advantage is when you can put the power into your car or be using the power during the day so that you dont buy the power back at night and pay a delivery fee on the power you generated during the day. Whom grid tied solar does help is the power company because it when in peak usage the grid is helped with your solar power which help's the power company ease it's losses threw transmission that they experience between the power plant and your neighbor's house because the power comes from you and not threw long transmission lines and they get delivery fee's for your power that your neighbor's use. The customer of the solar does not benefit from it unless you have your own batteries, inverters, charge controllers, and generation. Grid tied solar has the most benefit at a business that can use the power right as you generate it. All the grid does at this point is keep the frequency of the power in phase with the grid and can not be used if the power goes out on the grid.",
            "A well thought out video. So, here is my problem with solar and our government. First, I don't like our government tampering with the marketplace, punishing some and rewarding others by artificially raising the rates for some and lowering them for others. And I am no fan of taxpayers funding YOUR (not just you, but anyone's) solar programs, especially since we end up doing so by charging other customers AND borrowing money to fund it. And I despise net metering, because again, the government is tampering with the marketplace, usually with artificially high rates utilities MUST pay those who generate excessive electricity. This mean of course, OTHER ratepayers are being charged higher electric rates so YOU can get paid rates for your solar that are far more generous than they would be if you were simply providing energy. All utility companies work basically the same way, they create energy, through various sources, such as natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind or solar and they BUY excess energy from various sources though the open market. Whatever it costs to create it, they then must pay to provide it, from transmission lines to buildings, billing and wages, holidays, sick days, pensions, maternity leave, vacations, you get the picture, the costs to BRING it to you. And, they get a little profit, otherwise, it makes no sense to run the business. So, let's say the cost they pay create the electricity is 12 cents a kilowatt hour and they end up charging 24 cents a kilowatt hour for the other costs listed above. This is where net metering is unfair for other ratepayers. The government comes in and says, \"the utility MUST pay the rooftop owner 24 cents a kilowatt hour (or whatever their rate they charge others is). This makes NO SENSE, they can MAKE for 12 cents. They can BUY it from other sources at a much lower rate. How low? Big secret here, California sometimes PAYS other states to take the excess off their hands. So, a utility that can make it for 12 cents MUST now give you 24 cents a kilowatt hour, oh, but when do you get it? So, you did not USE your solar, but when you come home, you need electricity and your solar is providing nearly zero. Well, the same it true at the utility company, they are getting nearly ZERO from solar, so, they ramp up Natural Gas or coal plants. So, your net metering is paying for you to, not use \"clean energy\" sources, but the same \"dirty\" energy everyone else uses. Only problem is, the utility HAD to pay you 24 cents a KWH for it, which is an expensive source, so, everyone else gets a HIGHER BILL, because the utility must buy the expensive electricity. Make sense? Now, let me run some numbers for my house. I have a house in Northern California, it's Summer, many days are over 100 degrees California has some of the highest rates in the nation and my house is a little over 2,000 sq. feet and I have a pool, I run the pump for about 4 hours a day. I run fans to cool the house at night, so, my bill is a bit lower than my neighbors (according to my utility company). What is my bill for July? It's 111 dollars. Mind you, that is NOT all for electricity, my actual electricity bill is 70 dollars. The rest is, well, B/S, including Hydroelectric Adjustment, $0.22 Hydroelectric Adjustment $1.22 (I don't know why, we have more than enough water this year) Renewable Energy Surcharge $3.50 Greenhouse Gas Surcharge $0.13 Energy Cost Surcharge $8.46 Bottom line, 111 dollars for July. But my average bill is around 70 dollars a month, for the year. O.K. 70 dollars a month and that tile solar was 121,000 dollars. If taxpayers were not pickpocketed to pay for some of that, how long would it take to break even? 144 years. Ya, that's what the REAL cost of solar is, and my bill is artificially high, due to the government tampering with the marketplace."

So, between 10 and 20% of his average use would be for the car based of that. He must just be running massive a/c non stop, because if his house used the U.S average, there would be enough left to drive 130000 miles a year. Or drive 30000 miles and power 3 more houses.",
            "Dude, don't blame the car for your ridiculous power use without saying how much you drove that year. You are putting out false info about electric cars when there's enough of that already. Your power use is enough to have powered the car for over 32 000 miles and still have enough to power 4 average U.S households (which is already higher than a lot of countries). The average household use is around the equivalent of 32 000 miles in and electric car, assuming 3 miles per kwh. If your house used the same as average household, the left over power you used could have driven the car for around 130 000 miles. The problem is you wasting massive amounts of power on A/C just incase you get a little uncomfy sometimes and don't want to use a 50 watt fan, not the car. You said in winter when the car used upto 30% battery in one day. That's only ~30kwh for the day. Your average use is 149kwh a day. So yeah problem is you, not the car, you could be powering your house, your car and 3 other houses.",
            "Is it meantioned at any point how many miles are driven in the car each year? I didn't hear it. Can't really blame that extreme amount of power use on the car without metioning how far it's driven. Since the average daily power use over the year is 149kw hours per day (and must be a lot more in summer since gas is used in the winter), that's 5x the U.S average! Which is already higher than a lot of the world. Also means an average power draw of 6.2kw! If the extra 120kwh over average U.S is because of the car, then, if averaging 3 miles per kwh, that's 360miles (579km) a day, or 131 400 miles a year (~211 500km). Guessing it's not getting driven that much. I've heard the rule of thumb when thinking about getting an electric car is that you will charge at home, is to assume your power use will double. So for his use that would still be 27 190 kwh, x3 miles per kwh is still 81 570 miles a year (131 274 km). And still ~75kwh a day for the house. Average daily use at my house, is around 16.5 - 18kwh per day. That's in a decent size house, large reverse cycle air conditioner and pool pump running 4 -8 hours a day, plus solar heating pump running part of the year. Plus power tools and shop vac (1300watts For the vac) that get used a bit. So although I already have solar, (that in most parts of the year puts out more than we use) , and I want the world to end up with solar on houses and apartments, charging powerwalls ect, my biggest take away from this video is before everyone goes and spends $100k on solar and batteries, make sure your house is decently insulated, so you don't need to waste a bunch of energy heating and cooling. Then when it's only a bit hot you can just get a few ~$20 fans in different rooms and just put it directly on you, so you only need ~50watts compared to 5000 watts, cooling down the whole house when your only in one part of one room. Save the A/C for the actually hot days. Same thing with winter. You can have a comfortable sweater and pants on around the house, heated blankets ect and just heat the room you're in when needed. Don't have to have to whole house comfortable T-shirt and shorts weather all the time. If he had the average U.S power use, those panels could put out enough to power 4 more houses!"

My system produces 60kwh per day max in the summer (less in the winter) and on avg my house uses 20-30 kWh per day even charging my car in the summer and using ac, although I have a heat pump. My biggest consumption is during the winter months when temp drops to freezing the odd time and my electric furnace kicks in that consumes way more energy than my car, at this point my consumption can be as high as 100kwh per day. Overall my system covers most of my yearly costs with net metering. Your heat and ac system must consume a ridiculous amount of energy because I can\u2019t comprehend the numbers of consumption you have.

I live in a cold region where it get to -45c in the winter and + 40c in summers and have an electric car and everything in my house is electric and i am not even close to that many kwh .. you would of being better to make your house more energy efficient and then get solar power if your numbers are true .. if you are driving typically that only ~10kw per day for charging your car (30 miles per day) or ~4000 kwh per year. typically general house consumption ( appliances, lighting and entertainment) is 5000 - 10000 kwh per year. so 40,000 kwh for AC for only 1/2 the year or you are driving 300 miles per day on your electric car your current power walls do not have enough juice in them to recharge your EV at night if you are driving 300 miles per day .. if you go by New jersey energy stats it is $3000 per year (electricity & gas) and the average electrical consumption is 8000 KWh per year . so if you go by that basic stat it be at least 30 years to pay that off, if you converted everything to electricity . and in that time you would have to have to replaced your power wall at least 2 twice and your solar power production would dropped to at least %50 if they are not down to zero as roof shingle solar do not generally last that long perhaps 15 years ( so many connects that can fail).. but from your stats of 29kw of solar that will produce maybe 50000 kwh in a year and you say you have lots left over .. I think you over size your solar and you paid to much you will never get you money back maybe 1/2 at most (in reality i think under your current configuration 1/8 - 1/4 )"

            "I think the problem is, it's not like you'd do nothing else with that $93k, even just a 6% return would be like $5.6k in the first year, and it only compounds from there. You're not $9.66k/$93k after the first year, you're $9.66k/$98.6k, making the 'break even' longer than the predicted 9.6 years by a significant amount, or possibly even never depending on how much the cost per unit inflates over the next 25 years. After 25 years earning 6% on your initial $93k, you'd be getting around $24k each year. Perhaps electricity will inflate by that much, but even with the current record high it's less than double per unit what it was 25 years ago. Also worth noting that a 6% return is very much on the low end of what you can expect long term from even very safe investments, that's under the average for even a 60/40 401k. Don't get me wrong, I think there's advantage to being more off-grid in general and paying a premium for that isn't necessarily a bad idea, I just don't think it makes sense from a purely financial standpoint and would treat it more like insurance. On average, you wont see a return on insurance, but it's still absolutely worth having in many situations. Thanks for the video.",
            "Really fantastic video and great clarity on the topic. Would love to get this setup. For the next video, it would be amazing to see a \"real life\" investment breakdown and business case, such as what that invested 100k could have generated as an alternative investment over 10 or 25 years, balancing the lowered electricity bill. The average gain expected over 25 years if you invest 100,000 USD of course depends on a number of factors, including the type of investment, the fees you pay, and the overall performance of the market. However, the average annual return for the US stock market over the past 90 years has been 10%. This means that if you invest 100,000 USD and the market continues to perform at its historical average, you could expect to have around +500,000 USD in 25 years. Would that possibly have covered some electricity bills (9000 USD/y, + yearly inflation increase e.g. 225-300k in total electricity cost after 25 years)? Possibly, if you don't touch that money and there's no fund manager taking a big cut of the gains (and the tax man), but still.... Case 1: Invest 100k now in \"gear\" and enjoy free energy bills for 25 years. Need to possibly upgrade to a new system after 25 years for X money. Possibly save the planet (arguably not as it takes big chunks of carbon to build it all). Case 2: Invest 100k now in \"the market\" and have a couple of 100k left after all the energy bills are paid, to either continue to invest, or then buy a hyper effective system with next gen, 25 years from now, technology. Possibly save the planet, or not, depending on what you invest in (green funds?). This obviously looks different if you have to borrow the money and pay interest, or have the cash available to invest. Do you expect no maintenance costs on the Tesla installation over the years? The zero energy bill will come at some costs of maintenance I'm sure. What options does the Tesla contract come with? Naturally your current HVAC's would need replacement as well, but you have that cost regardless. Also, there's always the option of swapping that P100D Plaid to a more \"normal\" range car, just not as fun! Finally, to what degree can this system run without the apps - e.g. fully manually/\"electromechanically\" when Tesla decides to do something different, putting Tesla Model Z9 on Mars, changing the name to X and loosing all the value of the company, and then stop honouring the app updates - will it still work when iOS 26 is out?

Not one. 10 years free electricity, then next 10 years saving for replacement, its year 20+ where you actually make money. Look it up France is the only country in the EU with solar panel recycling. I dont think they do these tiles. They want a billion solar panels to be removed off roofs and replaced over the next 10 years as they reach 20 years use. Even if these things work for 40 years slowly getting worse, france and germany both want people to remove at lifespan and not use them forever.",
            "Conventional Solar panels deteriorate somewhat like compounded yearly interest mostly depending on the amount of sun and temperature of the panels. One chemistry and materials science guy showed how a certain careful chemical concoction paint could make metal panels into such huge heat dissipation units that they maintained a temperature a few degrees lower than ambient temperature, but the entire surface of the metal panels had to be painted with this relatively expensive concoction that had to be applied in a huge number of layers--the more layers the better. However, this could not be applied to the sun-exposed solar panel or cells due to blocking completely of the sunlight, thereby negating the input energy to produce the electrical charge. I do not know what the predictive math model for the solar cell efficiency deterioration with time and temperature. At all sun-exposed times, the cells supposedly lose their efficiency so that they have a half-life so that at some point some years into the future the cells become completely useless and don't produce any useful output power. It would be interesting for you to determine what is this math predictive model for the Tesla brand product, and determine how often it would need to be replaced if you wanted to maintain a minimum of 50% of the original efficiency?",
            "Do Solar Panels Degrade over Time? As with most technologies, solar panels will naturally produce less energy over time. This reduced power output is called the degradation rate. The median solar panel degradation rate is about 0.5%, which simply means that a solar panel\u2019s energy production will decrease at a rate of 0.5% per year.3 After 20 years, your panels should still be working at about 90% of its original output. Mean numbers are not real. You had to change those paneles in 20 years, they are saying 25 years Warranty, they are going to change your panels for free? What about batteries? They are going to degrade \ud83d\ude09. Make numbers again . My numbers say you are going to be making good in 30 years, when the entire cycle begins again.

You're completely self-sustainable.\" For people like me, who before your video did not know how little power you can actually store in the powerwall, this is EXTREMELY misleading. The PowerWall will NOT make you go \"completely totally off the grid\". It will not make you \"self-sustainable\" in any meaningful way. You will still be dependent on the grid, except you might not feel an occasional power cut. That's it. Forget about disconnecting from the grid or installing this system in a place without any electricity - with the current battery technology that is NOT POSSIBLE, unless your energy needs are unusually low (lights and maybe a fridge). Maybe you should have been clearer with this - not every person who watched the video understands the power needs of a household vs power capacity of batteries.",
            "@@YolandaPlayne One thing that I almost never see mentioned in these videos is that in some areas, if you do not have batteries on your solar system, the utilities require that if the grid goes down your solar system is required to shutdown as well so it does not cause issues with power feeding back to the grid side while they are repairing it. So you still lose power during grid outages even if your home could be generating power for you to use. There obviously are ways to disconnect from the grid so that feeding power back isn't an issue, but many areas have archaic requirements that don't care what capabilities you have, and instead require that for your system to be grid-connected unlesds you have batteries to power yourself your system bust disable itself during grid outages. Also net-metering is disappearing across the country quickly, because the utilities cannot make money from it. They replace it instead with systems that pay you the wholesale rate for what you send to the grid and then charge you retail like normal for the power you pull from it. So both of these scenarios make batteries a much better option.",
            "1) Even if you don't draw power from the grid, you do get/need the clock signal from it. Be it 50Hz or 60Hz, your auxiliary clock is not precise enough to keep you going for long. If you live completely disconnected for an extended period of time you may notice the clock in your fridge, stove etc. being slightly off after some time and/or your computing equipment may have a harder time talking to devices outside your household. During a power outage your personal clock generator doesn't start up to suddenly generate its own signal - you'd have crashing computers and weirdly behaving appliances all over your home. Instead, it listens in on the grid clock all the time and tunes itself to it, readying to take over if the need arises. That's how your app takes notice - since you're not drawing any power you normally wouldn't know, but the clock signal being gone is noticed by your equipment immediately. 2) You're not paying a utility base fee for having an account. You're paying that for being connected to the grid, for having people holding a steady supply of electricity ready for you whenever you decide to draw it, for them maintaining and expanding that grid in case you ever use it even when you currently don't. Not using electricity today is very different from not buying milk today. Imagine your setup breaks down or a longer period of harsh weather hits and they react like: \"Oh yeah, your line was cut in some construction work but because you weren't using the grid anyway there was no need to do anything about it. Want to be reconnected? We'll send you a quote and a possible date in a few weeks.\" This not happening is what your base fee is for."

Obviously this fluctuates a lot even with the market itself, and that in itself is a very good thing to know that you are now much less dependant on gas prices and the market, effectively making you not impacted (not at all, obviously, but mostly) by it. Another thing is the convenience of charging the car at home and having your car always ready to go, rather than having to go fill up the tank and some station. Doesn't seem like much but if even you end up being in a queue once here and there. Let's say what... you'd spend 10 min average to fill up the tank, and also the driving to the location, which is an inefficiency in and off itself. If you fill your tank once a week/fortnight. 10 min / week * 52 weeks that's 520 minutes of your year that you aren't wasting at the station, and the drive which we could say is very dependent on a person by person. But I wouldn't say any less than 3-5 minutes drive. You could be saving 8-12 hours a year on this endeavour alone.",
            "Great video, thanks. For return of investment calculations, I would separate out the money you save because you don't pay for gas anymore. If you fill the car once a week for lets say 60$, thats 52x60=around 3000$ a year. If you deduct that from the 93k you paid total, your payback period is more like 7 years. Btw, here in CA we pay around 40$ in mandatory charges per month:) On the other hand, we get the same money back for net metering than we pay (at least with people who have NET2 contracts (until April 2023). That means that under time of use, I paid and received around 63 cents from 4pm to9pm and 33cents during the remaining hours. Another metric you could use is total cost 95k$ divided by kwh produced under warranty (25 years) 54k x 25 = 1,350,000 kwh, which is around 7cents per kwh produced. This gives you a good idea as well if its worth replacing gas with electric heating. Lets say a therm of gas costs 29 cents, which makes conversion easy, since a therm has about 29 kwh of energy, so a gas produced kwh is around 1cent, unless you were in CA in Jan 2023 when the price shot up to 3.45$:), even then it was \"only\" 12cents a kwh. Better if you open an EV charging station and charge 60cents a kwh in your driveway:)"

Snow with ice surface at the bottom is really heavy when it falls from the roof and if it hits you into the head, it may kill you if you're unlucky. Here in Finland, most modern houses are fitted with extra hardware (kind of rails near the edge of the roof) designed to catch snow before it falls from the roof. Of course, that would prevent damage from falling snow but it will prevent snow from getting off the solar tiles so it's not without problems either.",

For roofs without solar panels, there are wires you can install on the roof to melt the snow/ice (similar to on plumbing pipes). I wonder if there is something available specifically for solar panels (a heated frame perhaps that goes around the panels to heat up during days when there is heavy snow/ice so it can melt the snow faster)."

            "The main questions/thoughts I have: You mentioned that your system has a 25 year warranty. What does that entail? Does that just mean if something breaks or if something degrades in output to a certain level? You have experienced this system in the best state it will ever be in while you own it. Solar panels degrade over time. How much production will have degraded in 3, 5, 10, 20 years? The degradation speed is the most important part to me, cause the only way you can fix this would be literally installing a brand new solar roof... and then what happens to all the previous tiles? It could end up being a lot less economically useful and not environmentally friendly like you think it is..",
            "Thank you for the video. I highly advise people who are considering anything similar but having spend last money on it - think twice and have your own research. While it sounds good of 0 dollar bill, there are many risks. Even if tiles have 25 year warranty, what are true conditions of that warranty? Tiles will definitely loose it's efficiency over years, home batteries as well. But would warranty help you change some tiles because of normal usage conditions and over time depreciation of tiles efficiency to store as much as in the first year? But I liked the fact that maybe car battery can help at this case. 10 year of investment payoff is quite large, especially taking first and the most efficient year of usage and then calculating the rest 9 years saying it is going to be same (unless it was considered but not told in a video). If home batteries will cut it's storage capability after 10 years in half, that would mean you will be taking more from the grid, same goes having maybe second electric car later as life is ever changing. There is so much to consider and some things might not even be predictable, like electricity prices after 9 years, but including worn on batteries, tiles and at least one or two breaks of the system to my opinion is vital, especially for people who not only want to be more sustainable to world like Marques, but to those who want to save some money or saving money was the only main aspect of getting solar tiles/panels. While tiles and solar panels might improve in every aspect later, could be also worsen to be more affordable to bigger group of people. So if you consider these additional aspects - I am more than happy and would definitely want a video after 9 years of usage with the numbers on how much and where today's calculation took a course off, or maybe not - that would be great!",
            "So couple of problems here. Panels will not keep the same performance over the years. Their maximum performance output will keep dropping constantly, especially considering they are tiles and not separate panels. PV panels don't like heat, that's why they are mounted _above_ roof so convection can keep cooling them. These tiles, can't be cooled like that and they just keep getting hotter. This means ideal payoff period of 9.6 years is not even close. In ten years those tiles will be around 80% (guess but significantly lower than 90%) efficiency and will have to be changed at some point. I'd hazard a guess payoff period will be closer to 13-14 years which is what you'd guestimate considering solar tiles are less efficient than regular panels which that assumption of 6-10 years is based off of. Also, while power bill might be 0$, you are still paying for your electricity, it's just you paid for it all at once. Your bill will be 0$ in 10+ years. In addition to all of the durability of the tiles, there's the elephant in the room which are batteries. Depending on chemistry they might be anywhere from 2 years to 5 years of life span. Which another additional cost to add for payback period. If it's Li-Ion like I assume it is considering size and the fact Tesla loves to abuse those, they are far from ideal for this use case and they will have anywhere from 600-1000 charge cycles life span before capacity starts dropping. In short, no it's not worth going for Tesla system because they charge like stupid, even with tax deductions which will only get smaller over time as will crediting system for electricity, both of which are designed to entice more people into getting solar systems. Once people start doing that, there's no incentive to give you free power during the winter because network will have too little power during the winter and too much during the summer. Generally speaking non-battery systems are better because there are fewer components in the system. There's no inverter, no batteries or replacement of those, etc. Cheapest investment is by far getting solar water heater. Electrical water heater, unless you have EV, is your biggest electricity consumer (30-40% in my case). Stand alone PV panels are better since they can be easily replaced by panels from different manufacturers and have higher efficiency. In summary, this whole thing is pointless unless you have 100k+ excess money to throw away in short term that you can't otherwise use in a smarter way, like getting insulation, installing heat pumps instead of AC and similar. Payoff period makes sense only if you have a lot of sunny days and electricity is expensive. Otherwise money is better spent elsewhere."

These companies especially in the north east will be able to meet and exceed the demand when electric cars take over.

On the other hand, only 3% of cars in the US are electric. And, of course, people will still use their electric ovens, even while their electric cars are charging. In addition, green activists are convincing politicians to electrify America, so eventually, only all-electric appliances will be allowed in new construction. A new Calif. law went into effect as of Jan 2023 specifying just that. And, by 2035, all new cars sold in that state will be electric only. This is happening in spite of yearly summer brownout warnings in the southern part of the state. That state's grid can barely handle its current load."

            "This is an excellent review, thanks. One angle I've been concerned about is does a solar system add value to the house? Have you done a calculation about this on your house? In other words, if you were to sell your house ten years from now, would you be able to get the value of the solar system into the sales price? Do you believe your solar investment has increased the value of your house? A review of this question might be good for a future video.",
            "A very important part of the money question I think was overlooked is home value added to the house getting the tesla solar setup installed. When you sale your house you are not taking those panels with you specially the tesla tile ones lol so you will get some of the money you spent on them back when you sell meaning you don't have to wait 10 years to sell your house to break even on the panels you bought. Even if you don't sell the house you can tap into the value you added to the home with the solar panels later with something like a cash out refinance where you pull equity out of the home, how much more it adds to the rent value if you move but keep the house etc.",
            "So one criticism, and to be fair it\u2019s an easy thing to forget. You mentioned how long it takes to pay for the solar system in electricity savings, but you neglected the fact that if you installed a $120k solar system to your house, the value of your house has increased, so you don\u2019t need to pay back $120k to pay off the solar system, you need to subtract off the appraised value that it added to your home. And assuming you used a loan to get the 120k, you need to pay back 100% of the interest accrued over the lifetime of that loan. People tend to forget that if you buy a house you aren\u2019t losing money, you are storing that money in an asset that is (usually) increasing in value. If you buy a car, car\u2019s depreciate, you lose money. A house appreciates. So to recap, to find out how much you\u2019d need to save to pay back, you\u2019d need an appraisal of your house done before and after installation, subtract the difference to find out the added value of the solar system, subtract that value from the cost of the system, then add the lifetime interest paid, and that will give you an estimate of how long to pay it back. Only an estimate cause the housing market can change, and so the perceived value of different aspects of your house will change over time. The system may become more valuable and pay for itself without the need to save money on your electric bill, or perhaps if the installation of these systems gets drastically cheaper and more common, your system becomes less valuable and you need to save more to recoup the costs."

Plus, my goal is to develop future sustainable homes for Australia, so it was super cool to see and learn about. wish me luck haha",

Yeah, you would say 'heck yeah, I'll charge at work for free every day and use just as much of that charge for my home to make it back to work the next day\". But if that ever happened then I guess that would mark the end of free charging at work, period.",
            "Good info. Top quality content, creation and delivery. TESLA currently doesn't support bidirectional charging. Their system will handle this capability easily when they're ready to cannibalize powerwall sales. The timing is everything as this cannibalization will free cells for battery grid storage and requirements for new EVs. The implementation of Ford/SunRun bidirectional charging installations are abysmal. Hopefully the pilot GM truck bidirectional charging goes well and ends up mainstream. Ultimately all manufacturers will move to bidirectional (V2H) although I don't see V2G happening until the federal/state governments and monopolistic utilities figure out how they will profit. Again, TESLA will be the leader, innovator and profit winner."

Thankfully they were on the house when we got it, so were free, plus no air con, IC car, and the house has a baseline of only like 150w. Even with the feeble kwh, it does really help knock a decent chunk off the electric bill. So worth it/ good? Yes without question, BUT like said in this video, getting a solar setup is expensive especially for a full solar roof. Really need find a way to make solar panels cheaper.",

In reality, certain parts of the roof get more sun vs other parts and as factoring in shadow cast etc, Im curious if higher efficiency cells strategically positioned on the roof (the 19kV -still huge vs most solar installs) would produce ~1/3rd less or would it be like ~1/4 less. As for the $9.2k annual bill... WTF? My annual bill (no EV) is $1.5k. Like I heard US rates are crazy expensive due to profit-driven utilities, but wow!",

A generic 5 kW solar roof in Italy it's around 3K euro, and you need around 7 years to get back the investment. 5 kW it's more than enough for a medium family in Italy considering you can't pull more than 6 kW from the grid on single phase. One Tesla Powerwall it's around 15K euro and worth all the money. A mega build, if you have big house with appliance like, pool, big AC, big electric car, etc, can be a 15 kW solar roof with 3 phase electric and 3 Powewall and we are around 60K Euro. Anyway, i would avoid Solar roof like that, generic panel are the way for a lot of reasons, lower price, easy installation, more wattage for cm2, more efficiency, heat dissipation is a big factor, that's why solar panel are generally not integrated on the roof."

Some newer homes have spray foam insulation where the roof surface could make a difference.

            "@@JungledG While absolutely true, Marques does not represent in any way the typical American, he's definitely a 1%er. On average Americans use about 900kWh a month, but that number varies greatly from place to place where as hotter & humid states (Florida, Texas, Louisiana) tend to use a few hundred more kWh, where states like California & Hawaii use a few hundred less kWh than that average (and maybe not so ironically those two states have the highest electrical rates too, where as the larger users have lower electrical rates) That said maybe his house also doubles as a studio, so perhaps there's crazy electrical usage there.",
            "It's interesting to me that nobody is commenting on just how much energy Marques is using each month! I with he would've said the square footage of the house for reference. Personally in a 2-person home that is 70 years old and 1,500 sqft (finished, but with a 950 sqft unfinished basement) in the KC metro area, I used 8,625 Kwh in the last year and that includes charging an EV which drove 10,000 miles. That's about 1/6th of the energy that Marques' home consumed in the same time period. If you want a much more efficient payback for your house, please upgrade your insulation before getting soler. We paid $2,800 after credits for insulation in the attic, basement rim joists, and insulating a crawlspace under an addition, which has dropped our energy consumption by about 25%. We don't do anything crazy to conserve energy: We dry our clothes in an electric dryer, and set the house to 72 degrees in the summer, outside of peak hours where it's set to 77. Our AC runs on 2.2KW, so it's either a lot smaller or more efficient than Marques'. Marques, please make sure your house has enough insulation. That would also help if you switch to a heat pump and electric water heating."

            "So if in the end the power wall didn't get you to your goal of fully off grid year round, would it be better to omit it and decrease the ROI time? The net metering credit you built up is what ultimately allowed you to avoid energy bills, so what difference does 40kwh going to the battery vs the grid make? At that point all the power wall did was prevent outages which seems like a minor inconvenience for their cost.",
            "In reality, you are actually only prepaying for the electricity that you use. If your $9600 a year for actual electricity billed by use and this equals your payments, you need to factor in the interest that you are paying for your system. If you have true net metering like New York, then you don\u2019t need to cycle your batteries and just keep them as backup because there is no cost savings and actually more wear to cycle your Powerwalls. And before everyone jumps on this, we have a smaller system and numbers don\u2019t change \u2026. I know what our monthly flat payment plan is and can easily balance it against my payments. Since we have net metering here, whether I charge up and discharge my two Powerwalls is mute because if I don\u2019t discharge the Powerwalls and send all excess power to the grid, when I draw at night it\u2019s the amount that I would have used to recharge the batteries of I had drawn that same power from them instead of the grid. So cycling the batteries will actually shorten their life vs keeping them as a backup source, which is what I wanted. Oh and we have all ac\u2019s as well as an Inground pool that draws approx 2200 watts per hour and runs for 12 hours a day from spring till fall. Even as green tech, the recycle and damage caused by sourcing the product is immense. We did it to help alleviate the kids spending since we will pay off the system for them and when they live here the system would be 100% cost free except for maintenance and repairs at that point.",
            "@@crelliseng The Power Wall is a buffer between power from the panels and power from the grid. Ideally during the day you will generate more power from the panels than you need, the excess charges the Power Wall and exports to the grid. Then when the sun goes down you draw power from the Power Wall before drawing from the grid, so you reduce your grid usage which is where the ROI on the Power Wall comes in. Yes, it is still there if you have a power outage, but that's not the primary purpose for it. Now, you could mean that because you're charging the Power Wall before exporting to the grid the effect of the Power Wall is net 0, but this would only be true with a few power providers. Most of the time what you export is worth less than what you import, the credits are less than what you export, or you will lose outstanding credit after a period of time so it is more useful to have a bank full of power than extra credit that disappears."

            "So, payback could be shortened significantly w/o affecting reliability by having 1 powerwall battery instead of 3. And could be shortened further, with the same reliability as neighbors, with no batteries. The majority of the power appears to go to recharging the car. The actual home operation, even in AC season, is less. (Fyi - try a heat pump - it\u2019s essentially a bidirectional AC unit but you\u2019d no longer need a gas powered furnace where you live) Using the grid as storage, which your home already does at times, would alleviate the need for local storage. Using your car as storage would also serve to reduce the benefit of the house batteries. Instead of charging it at midnight charge it as soon as you get home. I\u2019m afraid this also depends on how utilities charge. Where we are the actual cost of electricity is relatively cheap, but the infrastructure costs to get/take that electricity are fixed costs and about 2/3\u2019s of costs. Given that the two big power demands are your car and AC\u2026 would extra insulation and passive cooling improvements to the home drop your power use (shortening payback period).",
            "A thing that Alec's been doing in the mid-west is having his hot water tank power off _intermittently._ The way he explained it; he keeps his house _freezing_ cold in the morning treating the loss of energy as an inverse battery that loses potential across the day, and he treats the hot water tank as a battery that is storing heat energy for release as hot water. With larger capacity, you have larger potential use of that (lacking) energy. Man's pretty smart. Another smarty-pants move would be to keep on-hand excess energy for things like handsets, tablets and (using more capable banks) PCs with USB-C charging as a means of consumer-friendly battery storage during the day, and this would actually be nice as part of an office job where you're using _somebody elsse's_ electricity so you can keep your packs topped and ready for a low-power situation. Your automobile (while it is running) would also be a neat mode of charging these packs _while charging your car_ with someone else's power. For the enthusiastic, proximity sensors can be attached to always-on products so when you want them on, but you're not in the room certain features (or the device itself) can be turned off. For a television where if you leave it on and walk out, that's load you can reduce simply by _not having the display on._ Likewise for PCs the monitor doesn't need power if you are not in the room. Overall you can get more than net-zero, but the more people who do net metreing, the less likely companies will be generous with their payment schemes _as a matter of necessity._ But also, _now_ is the time to get into batteries because the material resources for these big cells won't last forever. This can get into some problematic discussion of EVs but that's scope creep better left for another video.",
            "Q? When you are charging your vehicle, are you using a 230V charging system, or a 120V charge? The reason I ask, is since you are only using 30% of you EV battery in winter (worse case) per day, you might be able to charge slower and still get a full charge in a night time, but not need to be on the grid. The slower charge uses half the voltage, at a lower current. The lower power requirement might be something your solar system (power walls included) can handle without a need to be \"on the grid\". As long as the necessary charge is attained in the time frame given, what does it matter. In otherwards, if you have a full 12 hour period to charge before you wake up to drive to work the next day (say you are home by 6 PM, and wont drive again until after 6 AM the next day), use the whole 12 hours at a lower charge wattage might be more cost effective (because this power might be available from your power wall, not needing extra power from the grid). Also, you don't necessarily need to charge to 100% each night... as long as you charge at least 20% each night from Monday through Friday, you'd still have a reserve of 30% remaining when you get home on Friday evening (from a 100% charge Monday morning) which could then be charged up over a full two days (48 hours) to get the vehicle back up to 100% for Monday again (assumes you only drive the car M-F and a worse case of 30% discharge in winter weather per day). Here's my math... please let me know if I'm incorrect on anything: Mon Start = 100% - 30% (Mon drive) = 70% + 20% (M-T charge) = 90% Tues Start = 90% - 30% (Tues drive) = 60% + 20% (T-W charge) = 80% Wed Start = 80% - 30% (Tues drive) = 50% + 20% (W-TH charge) = 70% Thurs Start = 70% - 30% (Tues drive) = 40% + 20% (TH-F charge) = 60% Fri Start = 60% - 30% (Tues drive) = 30% + 70% (F-M charge) = 100% * The above does make the assumption that you have the entire weekend of not using the vehicle and can charge the car up to 100%. It also assumes that at least 20% of the battery can be charged on a slower charge (120V) in at least a 12 hour period. This may vary depending on use and charge time. Thanks again for the video. I'm currently considering a whole home solar system myself, and although I don't currently have an EV, I might consider it at some point in the future, so I would like to understand all of this better (thanks for your help in my understanding this better)."
