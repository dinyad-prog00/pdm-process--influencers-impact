A Tesla to charge from 0% battery to 100% battery roughly uses 50 kWh to charge fully per day. If you charge 50 kWh everyday (You said you only use 20% battery in the winter and that's at worst) that would be 1,500 kWh per month. You didn't even charge your car for several days at a time. You also said you don't use electric heating so we can exclude that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Your) 4,532 kWh - (Avg) 1,000 kWh - (Tesla Car) 1,500 kWh = 2,032 kWh\n",
      "That means you have an unaccounted 2,032 kWh of use per month on average. (I would say this number is closer to ~3,000 kWh with average car charging kWh)\n",

      "WTF are you doing to use that much extra energy?! You are using an additional 2x the average family household kWh of energy per month. The average return of investment is around 10 years with the tax incentive but I can't see how you would use that much energy to make up the difference. I realize you said you are using as much energy as possible to make up for the cost but you also said you had enough extra for meter back to the power company for credits.\n",

Your car would become your emergency generator, or if your power wall is running low the Powerwall could charge up off the car and you could charge the car elsewhere, for example possibly at work or maybe one of the car charger ports might cost less than what you pay for it at home. \n",
      "\n",
      " Maybe you could charge the car with an off peak supply, which means the car can charge during the hours when the electric is at its cheapest, say between 1-8am, this is usually a service you can sign up too. Just a thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also some panels can drop the output when they get hot, and some large buildings spray a fine mist of water on their roofs to cool them, so maybe if you cooled your panels  in summer, maybe the output would go up, not that i would suggest spraying the roof with tap water, but you could harvest rain water that you could then spray onto the roof to cool the solar panels, and in turn you'd be washing the panels whilst cooling them so increasing your solar output. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you wanted to go overboard, you could harvest shower and sink water, pass this through a filter and use this to wash and cool the panels, which again would increase your output. however you could also reuse your shower, bath, and sink water to flush the toilets etc...\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing you could look at is a Sand battery, which could potentially increase the solar ability to heat water as sand obviously can get heated to a higher temp and slowly heat a water coil that could be running through the sand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing you could consider, is the Webasto Thermo Top C boilers that are often used in Cars, Trucks, Boats, RV's to heat radiators, as these use 100ml of oil per 1kw hour of heat output, so for example my 5KW boiler heats 6 radiators and a 245 litre immersion tank and it uses 500ml of oil per hour and up to 5 amps at 12v per hour, more than covered by your solar array. There are lots of fast food outlets in the states, so you could collect the oil and convert it to bio fuel that could then be used to heat your water and heating in winter and get you off being reliant on the gas grid, as you'd finally be completely self sufficient all year round.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did occurs to me that you have one system to heat and another system to cool, why not upgrade your heating and cooling system to a reverse action aircon unit, that uses the outside cold air to cool the house or the warm outside air to heat the house. It sounds daft but in winder we always found the house to be toasty warm considering the house was pulling the heat from outside even though it was bitterly cold outside, technology has improved over the years on these systems, but maybe the heat that your aircon is currently dumping into the air could be taking the heat and dumping it into a sand battery that could then be heating your hot water that would then reduce your heating bill and reducing your electric even further as the wasted heat loss that was created from your solar and pumped outside by the aircon would then heat the sand that heats your water, so in theory your solar energy would not only be cooling the house in summer but also heating your water at the same time and reducing gas usage.\n",

      " I live in Texas.  Several years back I sought proposals from 3 different solar providers.  The numbers just didn't work even if I believed the lies they all told like \"if there's hail damage to your roof, your insurance will cover removing and reinstalling the solar panels\" and \"solar panels will increase the resale value of your home\".   It was simple to explore these claims and learn that they were totally false.   In watching your video, I was shocked when you said that your system cost $120,000 less some government incentives.  Are you insane?   I have a 3,000 sq ft home.  I have very specific utility data by month back to 2006.  During that time my cost per kWh has increased from $0.11 to $0.15 dispelling another lie that energy costs are going to increase.  The offers I received were in the range of $20,000.  No batteries involved or needed, just the panels.  I have a co-op that provides power.  There is no net-metering per se.  They will buy power back at wholesale rates and sell it at retail. To be connected, the monthly charge goes from $10 to $20.  In Texas it's way hotter than where you are.  The main consumption of power is from the 2 HVACs that are on 240v 50A circuits.   I have owned a Tesla for 2 1/2 years.  It add 3% to my power consumption.  I do drive less that you do and do fine with the Mobile Connector plugged into a 120v outlet.  In 18 years the highest monthly power consumption was 08-2023 of 3,389 kWh which cost $359.  You claim to be a numbers guy but your numbers simple don't work.  For 2023, my average per month power consumption was 1739 kWh for an average cost of $223.    I have lived here since 2005 and only had 3 power outages.  One was due to a local transformer that blew, which created an outage for about 5 hours.  There was an outage for about 90 minutes when a HV switch box was replaced.  The other was due to a local lightning strike and lasted minutes.  Even during the Texas \"deep freeze\" power wasn't interrupted.  My home is on the same main feed as an essential sewage pumping facility, so no brown outs ever.  The last time my roof was replaced due to hail damage it cost my insurance $12,000.  I paid the deductible.   Buying a roof for $120,000 is just nuts. \n",

Also fo sho you want to figure in the BS middle-class tax break you get for flooding the pockets of your local banker (interest on a mortgage is deductable at your income rate).  So lets say your mortgage interest is 5% today (net of details).   You also have to depreciate the system across its expected life, and take into account that it will get weaker over time.

      " BEWARE Solar panels can be a very bad investment on a house for numerous reasons. 1) Homeowners policies can drop you for putting them on your roof, leaks ,holes,mold and storm damage to roofs and panels. 2) Power companys are now starting to charge customers maintenance fees ($50 per month) in my area because the solar lowered bills now are shorting the electric company all those extra transmission and maintenance costs listed on your bill based on power usage now lowered. 3) Payback is usually 10-12 years at least if at all, it can cost you more to pay for the system and service contracts then the electric bill for years. 4) Maintaining the system itself. Solar panels power output degrade over time about %1 per year, inverters fail (1 under each panel) and get taken out by lightning and then they will sell you a service contract further putting you in the red. Roof repairs from leaks atleast 60 holes depending on the amount of panels. The wind in storms ripping the panels off your roof and plywood with it. 5) Government incentives are disappearing yearly and power companies are cutting off buying excess power back to their system as time goes on. 6) Lowers the value of your house (not raising it) Nobody is going to want to buy your house if you paid off half of a $60,000 contract over time and that house still has a note against it for $30,000. You would have to pay it off to sell it, which means no benefit to you just losses plus the remaining electric bills you already paid.  7) May not even give you the savings you were promised. Some geeky kid with thick glasses and pocket full of pens and a calculator will promise you all the reductions in your bills but with no guarantees and not telling you all the pitfalls im telling you. I have alot of neighbors with them most are getting screwed. The direction your roof faces is a major concern but they will sell you the system regardless and probably oversize it as well to make up for the lack of sun exposure costing far more than the power would have cost.. Alot of unscrupulous solar companies putting them in. Depending on how much they oversize you may never break even. Especially with service contracts and repairs to the house because of leaks. The weather plays a big part in it also, so no one can guarantee you anything. (Sun vs Clouds) If you bought storage batteries guess what, they only last so many years and you have to buy new ones and pay to dispose of the old ones MORE COSTS!! and before the payback comes in!  Putting solar panels on a house can be a very bad investment, you really have to do your homework, they definitely are not for everybody, but even if they somehow save you some it wont be for years to get the payback meaning your stuck living there until the contract is paid off. And that doesnt mean you saved anything.  Its not the lower electric bill you need its lower money spent on electric, and if a $60,000 system over 12 years doesnt save you $60,000 - you lost. Plus the costs to keep it working and finding a Home owners insurance company that will write you a policy that will cover the system (Higher Costs Again) and wont drop you but at the very least the policy will cost you more on top of everything else.

      "\n",
      "Options:\n",
      "1, You could do a more efficient job of heating water using a direct solar water heater, with tank storage instead of wasting electricity generated from solar.\n",
      "2, The challenges with battery storage, is the rate of change of battery technology means that there are expected to be significant efficiency improvements over the next 10 years.  This will obsolete your power walls and your Tesla batteries.  The result of this is massive depreciation on your car, resulting in a net loss which will more than cover any potential savings in costs.  EV's also appear to be more expensive to maintain than ICE vehicles, and certainly more expensive to insure.\n",
      "3, As a result of the depreciated solar infrastructure, it will be hard to gain additional value on your home should you decide to sell it.  If you sell it sooner than the initial 10 years (you estimated break even) then you will find it harder to sell and make a loss on your investment.\n",
      "4, Solar tiles look to be an elegant solution, will there be improvements in efficiency over the next 10 years?  This is unknown at the moment.\n",
      "5, I may have missed it, but I did not see the homeowners insurance costs, and were you able to cover full value for the total investment, in the event of total loss?\n",
      "6, If you paid cash for your roof, then when you sell, there is no burden to carry over, or hope to convince the buyer to carry this burden.  I have seen too many families having been sold a solar solution and then be hit with a large payment on sale, and lost the equity in their home.\n",
      "7, It would be good to do the numbers of switching to a hybrid vehicle, getting mileage benefits and more cost effective long distance travel, with lower insurance costs and take the burden of charging the tesla, resulting in a more cost effective solar solution just for your living costs.\n",
      "8, Having the electricity company give you credits, is not as beneficial as them giving you a net payment for excess power generated.  What happens to the credits that get stacked up at the electricity company, should you switch to a hybrid, or hydrogen vehicle in the future, as you will be over producing electricity and unable to monetize it.\n",
      "9, I believe every home owner should have an app that shows them dynamically how much electricity they are using, so that they can see the costs of technology decisions.\n",
      "10, Rather than use a microwave, which many would argue removes nutritional value from the food, perhaps switching to an air fryer.  Instead of adding a temperature controlled mattress cover, consuming more energy, switch to a grounded mattress cover which would also improve sleep, but also improve health consuming zero electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "If in the future, some of the banned technologies become released, then zero point energy will dramatically reduce electricity costs.\n",
      "Also just in time hydrogen vehicles will also remove the need for vehicle battery charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with many technological improvements, things change, which take away their value.  We are already seeing Ev charging stations now charging for parking while you charge your EV in addition to premium electricity charges.\n",
      "Electricity utility companies are increasing their standard minimum connection charges, and this is expected to increase as more people take advantage of solar - reducing the value of solar solutions.   \n",
      "We could be at a transitional point in electric vehicles, until efficiencies are made reducing costs and reducing charge times.  Right now Ev's are not selling, resale values are plummeting, as nobody wants to buy a used EV in need of a replaced battery at a cost around US$60,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "An update after 5 years use would be really beneficial, and we can take a snapshot then of how life and technology has changed, and whether you were able to stay in the same house.\n",

You can buy a system based on Hydrogen storage. You have a few tanks of hydrogen (downside: they are bigger than the batteries). BUT they dont lose energy . The idea is: your solar roof is powering everything in the house every single bit of energy you are not currently using, goes into the electrlysis to produce hydrogen. The clue: Producing hydrogen provide heat and so all your water in the house (including the air-heating) can be used to produce hot water, so your boilers will also take less energy. As the storage of hydrogen is way more effective than batteries, you can simply have enough storage to come trough the whole winter. And when you need the most energy in winter as your solarroof is no more producing the energy, you simply reverse the hydrogen into Water (already warm) and energy ... so you get trough the whole winter without needing energy from the grid.

The slower charge uses half the voltage, at a lower current. The lower power requirement might be something your solar system (power walls included) can handle without a need to be \"on the grid\". As long as the necessary charge is attained in the time frame given, what does it matter.\n",

Also, you don't necessarily need to charge to 100% each night... as long as you charge at least 20% each night from Monday through Friday, you'd still have a reserve of 30% remaining when you get home on Friday evening (from a 100% charge Monday morning) which could then be charged up over a full two days (48 hours) to get the vehicle back up to 100% for Monday again (assumes you only drive the car M-F and a worse case of 30% discharge in winter weather per day). Here's my math... please let me know if I'm incorrect on anything: \n",

      "Fri Start = 60% - 30% (Tues drive) = 30% + 70% (F-M charge) = 100%\n",
      "* The above does make the assumption that you have the entire weekend of not using the vehicle and can charge the car up to 100%. It also assumes that at least 20% of the battery can be charged on a slower charge (120V) in at least a 12 hour period. This may vary depending on use and charge time.\n",

      " My solar system is now 10 years old [by 5 days 45.84 MWh lifetime] and only supplies me with 1/3rd my power needs [4.86 kW 18 panels, they are bigger these days]. I use a balanced payment system. It used to be reset in June and Mays production would often be so great they would be paying me. They switched to April 2 years ago. Me thinks they were paying a lot of solar users and it looked bad on the balance sheet. I am paid off on the cost of the system now due to a State program that would pay 54 cents per kWh in the form of a production credit [not taxable] annually for 6 years. About $2400 per year. All parts had to be made in state. It is basically how regulated utilities get paid for infrastructure. Also a fed tax credit of $7400. I also got net metering but power costs are lower here, for me 8.3 cents to 12.3 per kWh. Summer and winter have different rates with a base for the first amount of kWh and higher above that. I only get base rate in net metering but use no power for 4 months until the last 2 years. Pay $5 a month for a \"connection fee\". Spring temps have been lower for both of last two years. Buy 10 degrees this year according to the power company. The year before was 5 degrees lower. The Hawaii jet stream that gave us temperate weather has shifted. For a whole month this summer we were 10 degrees hotter than Irvine CA!! July is typically my best month, this year 816.62 kWh's. It is because I have a nearly flat roof and in July the sun arch is SE to NW over my roof. December is around 105 kWh's for the month. Depends on how much rain we get with the clouds. Rain adds a new dimension of UV reduction. Back when I got the system the projection was that someone in our area would need 2000kW of panels for 9000 miles of power for a Leaf.\n",

      "Since I did not hear you say it. Do you lose your negative net meter annually and get nothing in payment? I know people here [Washington State] who get monthly payments even in winter because they have super efficient home, mostly under ground! For northern climes your seasonal experience is typical. It is rare to see a smooth arched curve but it does happen. I think yours may be more jagged due to the multiple surface angles? I ordered 2 powerwalls the first week of May. They will be installed October 23rd by the company that installed my panels. By dumb luck I just might be able to file for a rebate from Tesla. They will also install a 240 60 amp line to my carport for future use. Panel installation's were booked for a year or more back in April for them.\n",

      "Thanks for the behavior of snow on the roof. My actions are more about reducing power use as much as I can. Installed a minisplit that replaced 5 baseboards [or 44 feet] and got air conditioning 6 months before we set all time records for high temps the next summer. Cut my monthly energy costs by $20. Nice to see the powerwalls can make it more efficient. Never in my life did I think that I would need air conditioning here until 2010. Laptops are more power efficient than a desktop. You can get power strips that are programable to cut off power drain of specific devices you do not need to be always on.

Literally causes the air circulated inside to condensate in a chamber and pumps it out with the wash waste. It is not for everyone but it should work very well for me. It is always on because it has wifi that will tell you when it is done! You can tell it to tumble a while if your busy. But the energy savings should off set that and many other small devices we love. It also does not have a vent. There should be 1/4 the lint in the filter as the fibers are better for not being hit with super hot air. But you need to clean the filter at least every 4 uses [it will remind you]. My dryer vent is a loss of heat in the winter for me and spews steam in my breezeway when running. Lately the cat has been knocking the vent connection open...  I think it was a sign.

      " In the Province of Quebec (East of Canada), solar panels aren't much of a craze simply because of the laws and regulations in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put it simple, here if you're connected to ANY electrical system outside of your terrain, you're obligated by law to be subscribed to the services of a government-run company called \"Hydro Quebec\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This includes any non-satellite cable distribution like the Internet or the phone. Then when you're subscribing to the services of that company, you're automatically charged with \"Access fee\" that cost an amount per day connected regardless of how much you actually used. On my last electric bill, the access fee I paid in an apartment was 0.43505 CAD per day. On a bill that covers 59 days, that's 25.67 CAD without counting the actual price of the electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you want super fast Internet via Optic Cables, you're automatically forced to be connected to the grid and pay that access fee. If you want a land line, you got to pay for that access fee and, here, by laws any business operated building (including self-employment) are required by law to have an accessible land line at all time. So this means that all businesses here cannot be void from that Access Fee even if they wanted to and are 100% self-sufficient via solar panels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the laws dictates that being connected to the grid with any form of power sources (solar panel or wind turbine or thermal heat generators) automatically set you up to what, in this video, is explained as Net Metering, but the crappy part of that is that HQ only pays approx 35%-50% of the electricity, in value, you give versus how it charges you. So you got to equip your house with basically around 2x to 3x your actual house consumption to make the electricity cost on the bill at 0$ by the end of the day if you're not using much during sun/wind time and you'll still be charged the access fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "With wind turbines, due to a political scam by HQ back in the early time when small wind turbine companies started to appears in the US, HQ is allowed by laws to take as much as 50% of your generated electricity from said wind turbine if they decide to do so and pay you as low as 35% its value for it. If you needed 65% of that power at that time, you're basically paying the access fee + 15% of the electricity even if you made 151% the amount of electricity you needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Yeah, here the electricity bill is calculated in value in CAD and not in KWh value so let's say that HQ pays you for 200KWh, it will pays you in CAD credits which will be deducted on the next bill or so on. As such, if the value of KHw fluctuates and raises, they aren't loosing money over the months where the KWh aren't used.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "I got to specify a few things about what I just wrote.\n",
      "The reason for the \"Access Fee\" is being charged just from being connected to the grid because it's how the company funds the repairs of the grids on a provincial level. It's not just about \"repairs\" in a city or town, but also about the high-power grids and lines and systems layered out across the province. Here, while towns and city do invest in major repairs related to their own infrastructure, the inter-city lines and grids are 100% funded and maintained by HQ and that money doesn't come from regular taxes (normally). The reason for the political scam and why the government accepted to implement it is because not doing would have resulted, from estimate, in a lost of approx. 18% of the current \"grid-connected\" users and that 18% would have supposedly rendered HQ unable to finance its province-wide activities on the long run which would have ultimately resulted in loosing more users, getting paid less, raising electricity cost to active users (then loosing more users) until its revenues would becomes too low to even fund the maintenance of the electricity grid which includes 4 Hydro electric dam that costed a lot of build, involves a lot of jobs and generate a lot of revenues to the country (not just the province). \n",

Cobalt is so toxic that it causes birth defects in the children of the miners for generations to come.  The miners themselves get sick and die.  This is made even worse because cobalt is mined by children.  If the children live long enough to have children, they're usually born with cobalt poisoning as well.

We live out in the country so I opted for a ground mount system instead of roof.  Your telsa roof looks beautiful!  Wish I had that kind of $$ to put into a system!  Jealous of the batteries as well - that will be Part 2 of our project.  We put in a 15kwh system.  We don't have an EV (yet) - but batteries and adding more panels is in the plan.  We went with Enphase system - and I can add 14 more panels when we add EV to use for charging.  We do have a whole house generator already so batteries weren't super needed - but will be nice and since our net metering with AEP Ohio gets converted to $ not credits of kwh - since you pay for distribution when you pull from grid but only get paid for generation - you have to send more back to the grid vs what you pull from it to even it out.  But at least their $10/mo 'being a customer' charge is paid by the excess generation.  Batteries just weren't in the budget - but nice thing is when that happens is the Enphase system controller (ATS) is able to be connected to the propane generator so if there is a long power outage (had one for 5 days years ago before we had the generator) that if the batteries would completely drain - say not enough sun or just using a lot of power - the enphase controller would power on the generator to recharge the batteries - which was a feature I really liked.  We only use 25-50 kwh per day - we only turn on AC if its super hot/humid - otherwise i'd rather just have the windows open.  So far with 2 months of the system being online we have $160 credits to use for winter - but that is what I want to see - will we be able to make it thru the winter without having to pay AEP anything.  We have propane heating but I'm also thinking of eventually changing that over to a heat pump.  Everything else is electric - water heater is one of the big consumers of power - then 2nd would be AC if used.  This was a great explanation of how it all works, and I'm with you on being able to stare at the app/numbers - I'm a stats geek.  Winter also waiting to see about the snow aspect - figured ground mount would be easier for keeping clean and removing snow - cause I don't do ladder/height if I don't have to.

      " This video is good for introducing the process of going solar and the various options, but I think it's also very misleading regarding how it potentially pays for itself in under 10 years when the system costs almost $100,000. The amount of power that his home uses per year is way more than an average house. Even with an electric vehicle. I have a 4200 ft² home with a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in North Carolina and used 26, 000 kW hours last year. He is using 54,000 kW hours per year. If he is using 28,000 kW hours per year to charge his Tesla then he would be driving around 75,000 mi yearly at 3 mi per kilowatt hour which is standard for a Tesla model S. You can also see that his power company has very different rates for peak versus off peak times. He's using an average of $0.17 per kilowatt hour. But if he is truly using that much power from his Tesla then his cost would only be $0.025 per kilowatt hour if he just charged his Tesla at off peak times. There is a lot of shady math going on to arrive at a $9660 per year utility bill. I think this would be a worst case scenario if didn't take advantage of any of the power saving options that his power company offers. If he did only charge his car at night during off peak hours then his total utility bill for the year would probably be half of what he is estimating which would then mean a 20-year pay off, not a 10-year payoff. These comparisons also don't take into account that you are tying up $100,000 that you could have otherwise been investing and have a significant amount of growth over 10 years. He did state that his main goal was to be completely off-grid and he did a very good job of doing that. But I think this video is misleading and could potentially cause other people to spend a lot of money thinking that solar power is a good investment. I have an 11,500 kW solar array on my roof and have done all of this math for several years. I luckily have a flat rate of 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour which makes it easier for me to calculate. The cheaper your electricity is, the longer it's going to take for your solar panels to pay for themselves because the electricity you generate is just not worth as much. It is very important to understand this before you spend a lot of money on panels and especially backup batteries as these typically will double the cost. The interesting thing about his situation is that if he were to not have solar panels at all and just have a vehicle that could back feed into the house and he had those three power walls he could be storing about 140 kW hours of power and he could charge up his vehicle and power walls at night for only 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour and then run his house all day long during peak hours using his car and power walls and that would be substantially cheaper option. \n",

      "1. I have a 1400KwH solar array on my roof (Palmetto Solar Panels). 1400 is the average amount of energy produced annually\n",
      "2. I did not purchase a battery system because it's not worth it. You can only be off the grid for at most a couple days before it runs out. Also, I am on the same grid as my local police station - so my power has only gone out for a few seconds since I've lived in my house\n",
      "3. My system was in total ~$60k on a .99% interest rate for 20 years with a 26% federal Tax rebate. I put the rebate elsewhere instead of back into the loan. W/ Rebate into loan it's $205 a month and W/O it's $285\n",
      "4. I have not paid an electric bill since installing. National Grid (my provider) provides credits that you then use in the winter when you're not producing much energy. I had $30 in credits left when I started going positive again in April just this past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Math of breaking even: At $285 a month, the price per KwH I pay (~1400KwH per month) is roughly $.20c (285/1400) per KwH UP TO 1400KwH before I pay National Grid their price per KwH. This means that I've locked in a rate of $.20c a month up to 1400kwh before I start paying national grid. During May - October, national grid charges $.14 per KWH and November - April, they charge $.33c. Unfortunately, I generate credits at $.14c and start redeeming them at $.33 most times. Ultimately, since I'm just barely self sufficient on the panels, my $285 a month is superior to the $329 I'd be paying national grid. ((.14x1400)x6 + (.33x1400)x6)/12). Factor in the monthly service charges you have to pay regardless of Solar Panels and the ~$40 of savings per month slims down further. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the thing to consider... National Grid (and all providers) will gradually continue to raise the prices of electricity. With a solar panel loan, you're locked into a price per KWH until you consume more energy than you produce. So while I'm at $.20c per KwH, 10 years from now that price will not change, but the price your provider charges will change. As an example, in 2013, National Grid charged $.07 per KwH. \n",

I’ve been advised that you can do a roof like that… if you cut a lot of corners and get a cheap roof that won’t last. Pink Solar also said they were going to do a whole eco package, with lots of insulation (maybe we could use more, but we already have some insulation), new LED lights (all our lights are smart LED’s already, so that would be a downgrade), a new Nest smart thermostat (I don’t want a Nest in my house, I already have an EcoBee that I like better, has no subscription fee, has remote thermometers for different rooms, and doesn’t have an microphone, so again that would be a downgrade). I asked if we could save money by dropping those downgrades, they said it’s part of the package and would install them all anyway. Final cost for roof, solar, battery, and smart electronics installation was going to be over $60k.\n",

We DO still need a new roof, but Solar is kind of an impractical chicken and the egg situation, and solar will have to stay a dream for now. \n",

      " Net metering sounds good and all, but this will very likely disappear very soon. Here in Holland, you can do the same (energy companies have to do net metering by law). The problem is: when you take of the grid in the winter months (more expensive electricity made by coal/gas/nuclear plants), by using credit from self made solar-electricity during summer months (which is very cheap: negative prices here even during weekends), it is a burden on everyone not being able to have solar panels.\n",
      "This is because the law of net metering isn't a subsidiary, but a must do for energy companies. Which means, they will crank up the kWh prices to still make profit. The real problem comes now: here in Holland, 25% of households have solar panels. Let's assume (for easy math) they make as much kWh in a year as they consume (net metering to zero, just like you). They can use the credit to compenate the  (higher) kWh prices, so it doesn't affect them. Everyone else pays 150% (50% more) of the price, to compensate for the people that can use the credit during the winter.\n",
      "When 50% of the households have panels and net meter to 0, everyone else will pay 200% (100% more). Extrapolate this to let's say 90% of households have solar panels and net meter to 0, then the 10% of people without panels will pay 10 times more than the value of that electricity should have been, only to pay for the people that can spend their net metering credits.\n",

      "The best way for long term will be batteries and v2x (vehicle to everything; you can charge your EV when you produce electricity during the day; or charge anyways because others do and it's cheap during these hours, and you can 'unload' this energy, from your car, to your house during the evening (when there's no sun and your energy consumption is higher). Batteries do basically the same as v2x, but you will see v2x very soon popping up more and more in EVs, because it saves costs on buying extra batteries.\n",

      "Here in Holland, we have a lot of wind and windmills, that make electricity prices low (and sometimes even negative during weekend-nights in the winter) when there is wind and demand is low.

This has pro and cons, as in summer, you can bank up a massive credit, when theres plenty and plenty of electricity, but in winter, or hard times where the electricity from the sun is either not enough to supply the demand, or it's not much, you have to get it from somewhere else, and that is often coal/fuel generators, that is not the green energy way to go, so you're not that green energy living if you pull a lot of energy in seasons where the sun isn't enough. Also, cost wise, you banked up a big credit when electricity probably didn't cost as much as it would be in winter, so it should be a lose lose situation for whoever produce the electricity in winter, as sun isn't helping much and they have to do it by fuel or wind\n",

They could power up fully during day time, and if you have 5-6 powerwalls, you could charge your tesla fully, from 0 to 100, during the night, if the battery and quick charge allow it. You can kinda live off grid, if you got a handful of batteries, or your daily use is not that high. Most families use 6-7kw an hour when cooking, and 3-4kw when cleaning and vacuum, so charging your tesla, would require more than a single battery, if your usage would even be low enough to be covered, as batteries can't empty themself that fast without breaking somehow, and when Tesla is gonna allow your car to act as a battery, you'll be even more aware of what/when/how, but you'll also be able to use and store way more electricity than before, and it'll last for longer, more closely to being off grid than ever.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I don't like our government tampering with the marketplace, punishing some and rewarding others by artificially raising the rates for some and lowering them for others. And I am no fan of taxpayers funding YOUR (not just you, but anyone's) solar programs, especially since we end up doing so by charging other customers AND borrowing money to fund it. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I despise net metering, because again, the government is tampering with the marketplace, usually with artificially high rates utilities MUST pay those who generate excessive electricity. This mean of course, OTHER ratepayers are being charged higher electric rates so YOU can get paid rates for your solar that are far more generous than they would be if you were simply providing energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "All utility companies work basically the same way, they create energy, through various sources, such as natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind or solar and  they BUY excess energy from various sources though the open market. Whatever it costs to create it, they then must pay to provide it, from transmission lines to buildings, billing and wages, holidays, sick days, pensions, maternity leave, vacations, you get the picture, the costs to BRING it to you. And, they get a little profit, otherwise, it makes no sense to run the business. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's say the cost they pay create the electricity is 12 cents a kilowatt hour and they end up charging 24 cents a kilowatt hour for the other costs listed above. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is where net metering is unfair for other ratepayers. The government comes in and says, \"the utility MUST pay the rooftop owner 24 cents a kilowatt hour (or whatever their rate they charge others is). This makes NO SENSE, they can MAKE for 12 cents. They can BUY it from other sources at a much lower rate. How low? Big secret here, California sometimes PAYS other states to take the excess off their hands. So, a utility that can make it for 12 cents MUST now give you 24 cents a kilowatt hour, oh, but when do you get it? So, you did not USE your solar, but when you come home, you need electricity and your solar is providing nearly zero. Well, the same it true at the utility company, they are getting nearly ZERO from solar, so, they ramp up Natural Gas or coal plants. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, your net metering is paying for you to, not use \"clean energy\" sources, but the same \"dirty\" energy everyone else uses. Only problem is, the utility HAD to pay you 24 cents a KWH for it, which is an expensive source, so, everyone else gets a HIGHER BILL, because the utility must buy the expensive electricity.

      "The average gain expected over 25 years if you invest 100,000 USD of course depends on a number of factors, including the type of investment, the fees you pay, and the overall performance of the market. However, the average annual return for the US stock market over the past 90 years has been 10%. This means that if you invest 100,000 USD and the market continues to perform at its historical average, you could expect to have around +500,000 USD in 25 years. Would that possibly have covered some electricity bills (9000 USD/y, + yearly inflation increase e.g. 225-300k in total electricity cost after 25 years)? Possibly, if you don't touch that money and there's no fund manager taking a big cut of the gains (and the tax man), but still.... \n",

      "\n",

      " So couple of problems here. Panels will not keep the same performance over the years. Their maximum performance output will keep dropping constantly, especially considering they are tiles and not separate panels. PV panels don't like heat, that's why they are mounted _above_ roof so convection can keep cooling them. These tiles, can't be cooled like that and they just keep getting hotter. This means ideal payoff period of 9.6 years is not even close. In ten years those tiles will be around 80% (guess but significantly lower than 90%) efficiency and will have to be changed at some point. I'd hazard a guess payoff period will be closer to 13-14 years which is what you'd guestimate considering solar tiles are less efficient than regular panels which that assumption of 6-10 years is based off of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, while power bill might be 0$, you are still paying for your electricity, it's just you paid for it all at once. Your bill will be 0$ in 10+ years. In addition to all of the durability of the tiles, there's the elephant in the room which are batteries. Depending on chemistry they might be anywhere from 2 years to 5 years of life span. Which another additional cost to add for payback period. If it's Li-Ion like I assume it is considering size and the fact Tesla loves to abuse those, they are far from ideal for this use case and they will have anywhere from 600-1000 charge cycles life span before capacity starts dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, no it's not worth going for Tesla system because they charge like stupid, even with tax deductions which will only get smaller over time as will crediting system for electricity, both of which are designed to entice more people into getting solar systems. Once people start doing that, there's no incentive to give you free power during the winter because network will have too little power during the winter and too much during the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking non-battery systems are better because there are fewer components in the system. There's no inverter, no batteries or replacement of those, etc. Cheapest investment is by far getting solar water heater. Electrical water heater, unless you have EV, is your biggest electricity consumer (30-40% in my case). Stand alone PV panels are better since they can be easily replaced by panels from different manufacturers and have higher efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this whole thing is pointless unless you have 100k+ excess money to throw away in short term that you can't otherwise use in a smarter way, like getting insulation, installing heat pumps instead of AC and similar. Payoff period makes sense only if you have a lot of sunny days and electricity is expensive. Otherwise money is better spent elsewhere. \n",

      "Marques spent $120,948.04, in today's dollars, for his tiles, tile connectors, batteries, equipment to connect to the grid, conduits, and labor.  His first offense is that he required taxpayers, most of whom don’t have and can’t afford solar, to pay $28,401.31 of his cost.  Remember, his huge taxpayer subsidy didn’t reduce the cost of the system (Tesla installers still got the $121K), it just shifted the cost from Marques to taxpayers who can’t afford his system and didn’t approve him spending their money.  And then he says this taxpayer subsidy “has gone up” another $8,000 since he put in his solar system, insinuating that this is a good thing.  It’s not.  Requiring even more of taxpayers’ hard-earned money to subsidize this type of project is absurd and unjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marques incorrectly believes that the “payback period” should be used and is a valid financial investment term. “Payback period” is not a valid financial investment term. For his analysis, net present value, or NPV, is the correct term and method that must be used. In summary, $1 today is worth more than $1 a year from now.\n",
      "\n",
      "To analyze a return on investment, Marques must discount each of his assumed future annual dollar savings back to the date he paid for the cost of the system (to account for inflation).  This means the true annual savings will be far less for a valid ROI analysis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, his average $9,663.11 annual savings is not even correct for his first year, let alone his 10th year.  He’d have to discount savings during the first year by 8.3% (inflation in 2022), resulting in $8,861.07 in annual savings.  His savings in the 10th year must be reduced by assumed inflation over those 10 years.  Assuming a conservative 4% annual inflation over 10 years, his annual savings in year 10, in today’s dollars, are $6,528.05.  Or much lower if we assume current inflation rates continue.   To complete the ROI, Marques should subtract these discounted savings from $120,948.04.  Only if the result is a negative number would this investment make any economic sense.  At 4% annual inflation (the assumed discount rate), it is 18 years before cumulative savings are greater than his initial costs.  At 6% annual inflation (discount rate), it is 24 years before cumulative savings are greater than his initial costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marques said he “could be completely off the grid for days and weeks at a time if I find somewhere else to charge the [electric] car”.  So, Marques, you would not be off the grid, you’d be on the grid.  So why say you would be off the grid?  And Marques wants everything for free, so he complains that his utility charges him $5.75/month just to have an account.  Is he showing signs of being a liberal?  I digress.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d take the $120,948.04, invest it in a stock market index fund, and sit back and watch it grow at 7% per year (the 50 year average annual growth rate of the stock market). Or significantly more over the past seven years.  By year 10, I’d have double the investment.  And live a bit colder in the winter and warmer in the summer.  Sacrificing for the planet, get it? \n",

      "5. why does your company credit in kWh instead of $? since we know there are 3 tiers of electricity cost (peak, shoulder and off peak), a kWh during the day is not equal to a kWh at night. it just seems like they should be paying or at least crediting you with $ instead of kWh. also, how can they reset credits at the end of year? isn't that stealing? you didnt give the amount of kWh forfeited, but i'm betting it is at least worth a year or two of ROI.\n",
      "6. above questions regarding billing need to be answered, and homeowner research must go into such detail. if you are lucky, you can engineer a solution with less roof and more battery or vice versa and bring ROI down from 10 to 5 years. based on what you said that 9months of surplus generation gave you more than enough credits to cover the entire winter consumption, and that today you are actually considering increase your electrical consumption :P, you probably overpaid your capital expenditure on the roof. and ideally if your power company is somewhat good to you with credits, which seems to be the case, you didn't really need 3x powerwalls either (unless you somehow really value the concept of being offgrid as much as possible for some reason)--just large enough to back you up a few hours for that odd outage. however......\n",
      "7. i really believe that #4 is a real concern. being able to pump into a grid is acceptable to a limit as long as there are not too many home solar systems. essentially you are using the grid as a battery but not really paying for this service. in generally they are happy to get your surplus during the peak hours, but as home solar gains traction it would eventually be in the power company's interests to reduce this incentive as firstly they wont need you as much, and secondly they would need to upgrade the infrastructure to be able to handle private power generation at a larger scale. im referring to lower credit rates or possibly credit ceilings instituted over the coming years, if they arent doing this already.\n",
      "8. it is very important to minimize ROI date because it will affect your future opportunities to sell the house. if you are 5 years into your 10 year ROI, to avoid losing money on the house sale you would be limited to buyers who are likeminded regarding solar and can do the math to be willing to take on the upfront cost of the used system. \n",
      "9. additionally, you would also want to minimize ROI date to reduce your exposure to external risks which would eat further into your projected returns and delay ROI. #7 talked about risk from rational market forces. there is also political risk of new introduced legislation that is anti solar or anti private generation. this can be significant or not depending on your geo.\n",
      "10. finally you would want to minimize ROI date to be well within your battery warranty. 10 years is way too long given current tech. \n",

      " Is it meantioned at any point how many miles are driven in the car each year? I didn't hear it.\n",
      "Can't really blame that extreme amount of power use on the car without metioning how far it's driven. Since the average daily power use over the year is 149kw hours per day (and must be a lot more in summer since gas is used in the winter), that's 5x the U.S average!  Which is already higher than a lot of the world. Also means an average power draw of 6.2kw!\n",
      "If the extra 120kwh over average U.S is because of the car, then, if averaging 3 miles per kwh, that's 360miles (579km) a day, or 131 400 miles a year (~211 500km). Guessing it's not getting driven that much. \n",
      "I've heard the rule of thumb when thinking about getting an electric car is that you will charge at home, is to assume your power use will double.\n",
      "So for his use that would still be 27 190 kwh, x3 miles per kwh is still 81 570 miles a year (131 274 km). And still ~75kwh a day for the house.\n",
      "Average daily use at my house, is around 16.5 - 18kwh per day. That's in a decent size house, large reverse cycle air conditioner and pool pump running 4 -8 hours a day, plus solar heating pump running part of the year. Plus power tools and shop vac (1300watts For the vac) that get used a bit.\n",
      "So although I already have solar, (that in most parts of the year puts out more than we use) , and I want the world to end up with solar on houses and apartments, charging powerwalls ect,  my biggest take away from this video is before everyone goes and spends $100k on solar and batteries, make sure your house is decently insulated, so you don't need to waste a bunch of energy heating and cooling. Then when it's only a bit hot you can just get a few ~$20 fans in different rooms and just put it directly on you, so you only need ~50watts compared to 5000 watts, cooling down the whole house when your only in one part of one room. Save the A/C for the actually hot days.\n",
      "Same thing with winter. You can have a comfortable sweater and pants on around the house, heated blankets ect and just heat the room you're in when needed. Don't have to have to whole house comfortable T-shirt and shorts weather all the time.\n",

      " all energy-producing machinery must be fabricated from materials extracted from the earth. No energy system, in short, is actually “renewable,” since all machines require the continual mining and processing of millions of tons of primary materials and the disposal of hardware that inevitably wears out. Compared with hydrocarbons, green machines entail, on average, a 10-fold increase in the quantities of materials extracted and processed to produce the same amount of energy. For a snapshot of what all this points to regarding the total materials footprint of the green energy path, consider the supply chain for an electric car battery. A single battery providing a useful driving range weighs about 1,000 pounds. Providing the refined minerals needed to fabricate a single EV battery requires the mining, moving, and processing of more than 500,000 pounds of materials somewhere on the planet . That’s 20 times more than the 25,000 pounds of petroleum that an internal combustion engine uses over the life of a car.  Among the material realities of green energy:\n",

      "A single electric car contains more cobalt than 1,000 smartphone batteries; the blades on a single wind turbine have more plastic than 5 million smartphones; and a solar array that can power one data center uses more glass than 50 million phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Replacing hydrocarbons with green machines under current plans—never mind aspirations for far greater expansion—will vastly increase the mining of various critical minerals around the world. For example, a single electric car battery weighing 1,000 pounds requires extracting and processing some 500,000 pounds of materials. Averaged over a battery’s life, each mile of driving an electric car “consumes” five pounds of earth. Using an internal combustion engine consumes about 0.2 pounds of liquids per mile.\n",

      " Well done video, but the financial information is not adequately framed.  The tax credit people get is NOT a reduction in the actual cost of the installation and materials.  It is exactly what it sounds like ... a tax CREDIT that you claim on income.  So a person who would have otherwise paid 5,000 in taxes in a particular year would not have to pay that 5,000 in that year because of the credit.   But not everyone is going to pay 30,000 in taxes in a year ... in fact most people don't come close to that.  So the reality is that for first year of a purchase of 130,000, you would get a tax credit of \"X\" off of THAT YEAR.  This credit does roll over into subsequent years (until 2035) so your credit is more like a rolling 'discount' on otherwise paid taxes.  It does NOT reduce the purchase price of your investment ... that price is still a full-on 130,000 dollars.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That investment has to be financed unless someone has 130,000 lying around (not many of us).  The financing cost on a 130,000 loan every month?  Yeah - even on a GENEROUS 30 year loan term that is a monthly payment of over 600 dollars a month. Be generous and assume someone gets the payment to 500 a month?   That's still 6,000 a year just in financial payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the uber-rich who can pay for such a system out of their pocket this isn't a factor.  However, for the vast majority of people it is a massive issue that has to be ameliorated into the \"break even\" cost ... which this video did not do. Moreover, the 9,000 a year in electrical bills cited in the video seems exaggerated.  The national average for monthly electricity is more like 125 a month (1,500 a year).  Being generous and TRIPLING that to 4,500 a year gives the Tesla roof a 22 year break even cost ... still without adding in the financing cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "So factoring in at least a 500 a month finance cost (6000 a year) and an estimated 'savings' in an annual budget of 5,000 on taxes (25,000 over 5 years) it is an additional 180,000 over 30 years (financial costs) minus 30,000 in the first 5 years (tax credit).  Let's take that 5,000 in tax credits saved and put 100% of it to the principle of the loan to pay it down faster (though I expect most people would not be that dedicated).  Smooshing around all these fungible numbers you end up with approximately an additional 100,000 in financial payments ON TOP of the original purchase price of 130,000 for a total of $230,000 over the lifetime of the the system.  Divide that by the 4,500 yearly electricity cost and it is 51 YEARS before you break even in electricity ''savings'.  Its far more complex in reality because of types of loans, up front interest vs prolonged, etc.  But this is a simplification of the numbers to illustrate the point. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lets not also factor in the unspoken truth that the tiles and the batteries for this system probably won't survive 50 years, or 30 years, or maybe not even 20 years.  Or that you don't happen to MOVE in that time... Or that the Tesla roof tiles are nowhere near as efficient as simple solar panels using glass...\n",
      "\n",
      "Just some brass tacks reality checking on the finances of a project of this sort.  It is not helpful soft-peddle costs behind overly optimistic figures when the real life result is not going to be as user friendly.  Solar can be good ... but no one should walk away from a video with descriptions of costs that are not going to match the reality.  And the reality is that unless you pay for the Tesla roof 100% full price out of your pocket on day 1, then it is going to take far longer than 9 years to break even.  And even if you DO buy it up front, its probably going to take longer than 9 years because most people don't have 9,000 a year in electrical bills.  There are cheaper options. Factor in your interest payments folks and do not make the mistake of thinking a tax credit is going to reduce the initial purchase price needed when getting a loan. \n",

We are in 21th century with LED lights... It should be <10wh or else it makes me wonder what bulbs are you using. And in general you really use a lot of power.

If you wanna have more money you do BOTH - cut the unnecessary spending and try find the ways to invest money correctly. You setting up the solar roof is a good step towards 2nd part. Me giving numbers is about investigating the first part. What the hell is using so much energy. I might even come down to the settings of air conditioning like in summer you might set it to +1 degree higher and save lots of energy (dunno but again you don't talk about it so I just speculate as you showed your air conditioning is using 5kwh).\n",

      "\n",
      "Fancy way to monitor such things is to buy lots of pretty cheap smart power switches, set them up for many appliances around the home and gather data. I wonder how much can you save there. Also it would be way more interesting to watch instead of an tesla products ad + ecosystem guide.\n",

      "What would be a VERY INTERESTING EXPANSION on this test is finding and TESTING the highest possible wattages per square foot or square metre solar panels that are available on the market.  Most single family homes of 2500 square feet (232 Square metres) in size need around 14,000 Kilowatt/Hours per Year or around 36 kWh per day.  Since MOST usage of power is between 6 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 11 pm those 36 kWh have to be compressed down to a power delivery stream of about 3600 watts AVERAGE and as high as 12,000 watts peak usage on a continuous basis (i.e. for washers, dryers, air conditioners, heaters, ovens and microwaves). This means you need a MINIMUM of 24 of the 500 watt solar panels in order to account for peak usage. 500 Watt solar panels can be had for less than $400 USD or $9600 USD for a bank of 24 of the 500 watt solar panels that can collectively handle 12,000 watts peak usage!\n",

To smooth out the rainy days and dark nights, you need a battery pack system or some other form of energy storage system that SHOULD be rated for about 25 years to match the typical longevity of modern solar panels. In terms of battery longevity and power storage QUALITY, the newest iteration of LITHIUM-METAL (i.e. is NOT the current Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO technology found in Tesla Powerwalls!), is now your BEST BET for long-lasting batteries at 25 years. \n",

Typically, you need about 12 hours worth of energy storage to last the darkest of winter nights, so a 24 pack of the 5000 watt output Lithium-Metal battery packs ($48,000 USD) will give you full-bore 12,000+ watts continous output for a full 12 hours to smooth out your solar panel output AND take care of charging the home energy storage battery system!   If you DO NOT need 12,000 watts continuous output all day and night, you could cut that down to about 2000 watts for 12 hours (6 battery packs for $12,000 USD total) to take care of your night-time power needs!\n",

You might think that's fine but with a ICE you are still going to get the same amount of miles on a full tank and services are more frequent but low cost whereas in 5 years with a EV you might not have the same range due to the age of the battery and batteries don't last for ever plus the cost to replace them are stupidly pricy but also services can be more expensive. \n",

      " Great video and thorough walk through of your awesome setup! Interesting to hear how your net metering in the US compares to solar export over here in the UK. We actually get the credit into our energy account as cash rather than kWh so this can go towards what is known as the standing charge for both gas and electric, along with your gas bill too, if you've built up enough credit of course. This means that with a good and progressive energy provider like Octopus Energy (who also now supply in parts of the US I think?) you can kind of game the grid with a tariff like Flux, where you can charge your home battery at night when the grid energy is cheaper, and the force discharge it in the afternoon between 4pm-7pm when grid demand is highest and most expensive along with any additional excess solar, and get paid more for this export than you would've paid for it from the grid to make a higher net profit. They've also just announced an advanced version of this tariff that you would go wild for as a tech guru, called Intelligent Flux, where they will connect to your home battery's API to remotely automate this process based on daily national grid demand and needs, charging your battery for you at the cheapest times, predicting how much solar will be generating on a particular over your home based on weather forecasts, so balancing the grid charge with charge from your solar into your batteries intelligently, and then exporting for you at the peak time based on your home usage patterns to help support the grid with green energy whilst leaving enough for you and ensuring your bill is basically zero. It's not quite ready for release yet but should be in the next few weeks and should be interesting to see how this works!\n",

      "One note about May being your best generation that you missed: this is often the case in our sorts of latitudes and climates because solar panels degrade in performance when they are too hot, which is why you may often see at the peak of summer on a blazing hot day your peak solar performance may be lower than when it is cooler with a few clouds in the sky but still very sunny. May is the perfect Goldilocks month for solar panels where it's not too hot but there is lots of sun. There is also a phenomenon when it is partially cloudy but still sunny that you will notice where your generation peaks higher than on a perfectly clear day because the light is reflected off the white clouds and bounces with some greater intensity, but it's mostly just the temperature of panels that can impact solar generation on traditional panels, so I'm assuming Tesla tiles are also impacted in a similar way too? 🤔 \n",

      " There is a very important factor in all of this that I think is crucial for people researching solar to understand. It has to do with needing a battery or not due to how good your net metering is. One thing that you did not mention is that different utility companies buy the kWhs back for different amounts. New Jersey, along with several other states in the northeast have what we called 1 to 1 net metering agreements. This is where you get full retail value for the power that is sent back to the grid. In California for example, we just had net metering 3.0 passed in April, which dropped the buyback value by 75%. The most important aspect to understand when you’re going solar is if you need a battery for the purpose of getting rid of your bill, or if you need the battery as a back up. I’m not sure if you actually knew this when you designed your system with Tesla because they don’t offer systems without a battery, but if you are in a utility with one to one net metering like you are, you can still achieve the exact same zeroed out bill without any battery because the excess power is simply sent back to the grid in the daytime and that credit will completely pay for your nighttime usage. Now, if you are in California or a state that does not offer net metering that has a similar to retail value buyback, then the battery is a necessity in order to alleviate the cost of buying power from the grid. But in New Jersey, for example, where you are, the only value that battery is providing you is backup in the event of an outage.  Those batteries are not helping your bill be zeroed out and without knowing all of the details, I would assume the battery portion of your project was around $40,000 which means that your gross cost entry could have been about $40,000 less in theory and you could still have achieved the same bill at the end of the day. I am definitely all four people getting batteries for a back up. If they feel the price is worth it but without batteries, I’m sure your payback. Actually would have been a lot closer to six or seven years because that is what my customer see you when I saw them a system in New Jersey for example. My YouTube channel is obviously way smaller than yours but I’m a solar consultant and I make solar related videos. Great job again and this was one of my favorite videos you’ve ever made.
